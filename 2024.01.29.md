39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,700
 What's up?

40
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,060
 Welcome to today's live stream.

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,640
 I am Will, and today is what I say today.

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,300
 Today is Friday.

43
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,300
 You think I know what day it is, but I don't.

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,300
 It's the ninth.

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,140
 It's very very nice, 2024.

46
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,340
 I think this is my second stream of the week.

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,460
 I haven't been really feeling that great.

48
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,460
 So I haven't been streaming as much,

49
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,860
 but hopefully you all have enjoyed the videos

50
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,020
 that I've been doing as an alternative.

51
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,100
 Those are much quicker.

52
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,980
 It takes me about five to 10 minutes

53
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,060
 to record it in about 20 to 30 to edit it.

54
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,900
 My city edit it.

55
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,500
 I'm doing a city edit.

56
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,020
 Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,020
 Oh, TGI.

58
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,980
 Honestly, I didn't realize that meant thank God it's Friday

59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,380
 until I was much older.

60
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,860
 I thought it meant Fridays.

61
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,620
 You know the restaurant?

62
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,060
 So I thought I was mad.

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,540
 I'm having issues with Twitch.

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,780
 For whatever reason, it won't load.

65
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,420
 So I don't know if my stream is working on Twitch.

66
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,900
 So if anybody is actually, I could just check.

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,660
 Yeah, if anybody can like load Twitch and let me know,

68
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,220
 that would be great.

69
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,580
 Anyway, so I'm gonna go ahead and jump right

70
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,860
 into the stream share.

71
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,780
 And look at that.

72
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,700
 We got Gemini.

73
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,740
 So I got an email before I restarted my computer.

74
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,340
 I just did an update.

75
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,660
 And the email was like, Bart is renamed to Gemini,

76
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,460
 rebranded under Gemini.

77
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,340
 I'm like, leave it to Google.

78
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,140
 I'll just change the name of something always.

79
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,580
 This is much better than I actually agree

80
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,420
 with this name change.

81
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,860
 It's actually a much better name than Bart.

82
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,140
 It's the stupidest name ever.

83
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,820
 It sounds like some UC in Silicon Valley.

84
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,020
 Just like some Pied Piper bullshit.

85
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,260
 Ah.

86
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,140
 But yeah, I got a couple things that I can do today.

87
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,820
 Oh, you said it's working fine.

88
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,900
 All right, well, I appreciate it.

89
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,980
 I'm gonna just give up.

90
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,420
 I tried to, I was trying to load it.

91
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,420
 And it wasn't working out.

92
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,860
 And let me put something else on the TV right foot.

93
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:55,940
 Oh wait, I just do it from my phone.

94
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,380
 I think that'll be easier.

95
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,300
 Or, okay, I'll do it on the other phone.

96
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,860
 Fine, sure.

97
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,700
 I don't know what, I don't understand Apple sometimes.

98
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,580
 Like, which, how does it know what device to use?

99
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,180
 'Cause I have like all these devices in.

100
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,780
 It never opens up on the right device,

101
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,580
 which is the one that's in my hand.

102
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,460
 Wait, seriously?

103
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,940
 Come on, God, dang it.

104
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,140
 I really, I don't understand Apple sometimes.

105
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,100
 How do they make such shitty software?

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,660
 Don't they have money to hire decent engineers?

107
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,780
 (upbeat music)

108
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,180
 All right, there we go.

109
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,020
 We're good.

110
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,180
 Yeah, so, like I was saying,

111
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,620
 there are a couple things that I can work on today.

112
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,420
 I can either do a quick vision app,

113
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,220
 when I say app, it's really gonna be an end quote.

114
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,180
 This is, it would be just me testing

115
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,660
 to see if I can get a push notification

116
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,780
 and integrate it with, you know,

117
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,620
 the product that we build at my company.

118
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,900
 Or, and this is probably much,

119
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,700
 I don't know, it's probably something that I should do,

120
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,140
 I could work on a new feature

121
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,520
 for the bot that I've been building.

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,180
 Or, here's another or,

123
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,140
 I can begin working on that app

124
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,980
 that I'm trying to build called Nega.

125
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,140
 And before you at me, it's Chinese, that's it.

126
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,100
 (laughs)

127
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,940
 It's Chinese.

128
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,700
 I'm not saying the one.

129
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,860
 But if you know, you know.

130
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,900
 All right, come on Discord, what's up with this?

131
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,980
 Every time I restart, I just did an update.

132
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,900
 And just things, it's just, I don't understand.

133
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,940
 Why is it so silly?

134
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,580
 All right, somebody wanted to join,

135
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,780
 or some folks wanted to join this stream,

136
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,300
 so I'm gonna go ahead and open up a Zoom thing, Magic.

137
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,180
 All right, so, if you're watching this,

138
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,100
 I don't know who's watching,

139
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,700
 but if you're watching, go to Slack,

140
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,820
 go to the channel, "Famine Glory",

141
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,420
 and you should see a Zoom link,

142
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,820
 like an, just click on that.

143
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,300
 And it should redirect you to this meet that I just started.

144
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,300
 And then we go ahead and turn on my camera,

145
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,860
 so that we, you know, he can see me whenever he comes,

146
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,460
 and we'll turn on audio.

147
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,700
 Let's move this, it's over here.

148
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,500
 All right, so, given that I have all these decisions to make,

149
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,860
 I'm a first start off by, oh wait, oh shit,

150
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,340
 I think let's quit things first.

151
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,340
 I don't understand, like, why does Apple

152
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,900
 offer to open up all the windows that were open,

153
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,220
 and then when it does, it's like, it doesn't work.

154
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,620
 It's just like not the things that I had opened.

155
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,940
 My entire session's going,

156
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,700
 you know, maybe that's an arc issue,

157
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,020
 it's probably an arc issue.

158
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,020
 Guess we'll open up Visual Studio Code.

159
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,100
 I'm learning the code today,

160
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,540
 so I can either learn Swift,

161
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,460
 or I can learn TypeScript, JavaScript,

162
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,860
 all the languages that I use,

163
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,260
 in order to do the work that I need to do.

164
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,820
 All right, we'll delete this for now,

165
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,180
 and let's see.

166
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,740
 Yeah, well, yeah, sure.

167
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,300
 Actually, no, I'm opening up a better web browser

168
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,820
 for development, we'll open up a Firefox developer.

169
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,780
 And I'm also gonna open up Xcode just in case

170
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,420
 I decide that I wanna get Swiftie,

171
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,020
 and do some VisionOS stuff.

172
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,300
 I got the VisionOS over there.

173
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,700
 Honestly, it's such a hassle.

174
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,460
 It is really a hassle.

175
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,380
 Like, you gotta put it on,

176
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,260
 you gotta have a frickin' battery brick in your pocket,

177
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,000
 you gotta, what else you gotta do?

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,840
 You gotta wait a minute for it to start up,

179
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,600
 and then, on top of that,

180
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,040
 you have to plug in the thing.

181
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,680
 Technically, I don't have to do it while I'm at home.

182
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,480
 I should be able to do it.

183
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,800
 I did something on my network where now my Mac Studio

184
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,200
 is on the network, I have multiple networks at my house.

185
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,640
 Let's just, I have to be extra complicated

186
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,840
 because of reasons.

187
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,000
 Let me put this over here.

188
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,240
 And we're gonna create a new project, our click.

189
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,680
 By the way, if you're gonna enjoy,

190
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,680
 my one enjoy because it's slow sound my computer,

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,600
 so if you're not gonna enjoy it,

192
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,320
 I'm gonna quit this Zoom thing.

193
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,760
 All right, let's do, let's not do that yet.

194
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,920
 Let's not do that yet.

195
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,160
 This first get a development environment set up.

196
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,880
 We'll open up my favorite Git tool, GitHub desktop.

197
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,760
 By the way, if you're learning to code,

198
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
 and you're learning all this software development stuff,

199
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,160
 and all that, GitHub desktop is awesome.

200
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,000
 You don't have to know Git at all.

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,160
 It could be like me and not know anything.

202
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,920
 Y'all, I'm busy tonight, just wanted to say,

203
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,760
 what's up and gonna leave it like that.

204
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,680
 Yo, what's up, Ken, let's talk to me.

205
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,920
 It's been a minute.

206
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,880
 Yeah, I mean, it's a weekend.

207
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,120
 I know that other people have lives.

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
 You don't have to feel obligated to be here.

209
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,840
 But no, there'll be a VOD,

210
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,560
 so if you wanna check out what it is

211
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
 that I eventually end up doing,

212
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,520
 just go check out the VOD,

213
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,480
 and you could drop comments there

214
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,160
 if there's something that you want to learn more about,

215
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,520
 or if there's something else that you wanna see.

216
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,920
 Oh, yeah, yeah, turn on your camera.

217
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
 By the way, you won't appear,

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
 so don't worry about appearing.

219
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,360
 You're good, and I'm talking to you.

220
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
 I don't wanna say your name,

221
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,000
 because I don't know if you want me to say your name on live.

222
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,360
 The person always doing that's what I'm talking to.

223
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,360
 All right, so let's go ahead and set up another workspace.

224
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,920
 All right, and guess what, open up my database viewer,

225
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,200
 Themajic, open up Slackbots, and look at that.

226
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,520
 I think last time I spent time deleting tables,

227
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,720
 if I'm not mistaken, I think I deleted all of my tables,

228
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,520
 'cause I decided that I don't wanna do any type of work,

229
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,000
 or I don't wanna put effort in taking this.

230
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
 No, I didn't, okay, so this video's table

231
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,880
 will eventually go away.

232
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,160
 I don't need it, I don't care about it anymore.

233
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,880
 The only reason why I still hear is because if I do delete it,

234
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,440
 it's gonna actually break stuff.

235
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,680
 Yo, what's up, how you doing?

236
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,240
 - Yo.

237
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,760
 - What do you want me to call you while we're online streaming?

238
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,600
 Do you care?

239
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 - You know, I'm who's your man.

240
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,760
 - All right, well, I don't know.

241
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,600
 - I'm crazy.

242
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,880
 - So there are other people in the Slack

243
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,760
 who, when they're on, we have to use aliases.

244
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,520
 That's why I don't like who knows this, let me know.

245
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,720
 But you're not actually on the stream,

246
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,320
 but they can hear you, everybody can hear you.

247
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,520
 So if you're watching, what you will wanna do

248
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,160
 is mute the stream.

249
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,000
 - Nah, yeah, I got it.

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
 - Okay, okay.

251
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,680
 - I did that already.

252
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,400
 It'll be echoing.

253
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,520
 - Yeah, yeah, it'll be echoing.

254
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,800
 And I can share my screen with you.

255
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,840
 Fortunately, I know it's gonna slow down my computer,

256
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,560
 so it's like the patience I have it,

257
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,080
 I've built up the patience to deal with this shit.

258
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,320
 We will not share sound, we'll just keep the desktop.

259
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,400
 All right, so you should be able to see

260
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,280
 what I'm looking at right now.

261
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,960
 It should not be laggy anymore.

262
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,160
 I mean, it's laggy for me,

263
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,440
 but it won't lag, you know, time-wise for you.

264
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,160
 - Yeah, I can actually see what's going on.

265
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,520
 And YouTube, it's always, I don't know,

266
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,600
 I have it then like,

267
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,720
 it's not like a window, but it'll just be smaller.

268
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,720
 - Yeah, yeah, on YouTube, I'm streaming at 1440p.

269
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,640
 Now, I don't know what it looks like

270
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,800
 if you don't have YouTube premium.

271
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,040
 So if you have YouTube premium,

272
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
 I could never gonna pay for YouTube.

273
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
 - I'm not even mad at this.

274
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
 - I've been a paying person for like years,

275
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,600
 but back when they used to have Google music,

276
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,080
 when it was like, you got Google music

277
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,280
 and you got all these other things, Google photos,

278
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,040
 and it was all part of the subscription for $10.

279
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,120
 And like most subscriptions,

280
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,200
 it's just kind of stuck around.

281
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,520
 You know, for the past eight or nine,

282
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,160
 however many years I've added.

283
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,360
 But I probably have, no, no,

284
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,200
 I've actually been paying more money from YouTube

285
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,160
 than I've paid them so far.

286
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,720
 Now, if I continue to go,

287
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,560
 - Hey, that's not positive.

288
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,400
 - You good.

289
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,560
 - Well, no, I mean, no, and I'm only good

290
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,240
 if I am able to get monetized again by the end of this year.

291
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,560
 Because, you know, every year it's like $120 and like,

292
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,800
 10, 15, I don't know, maybe YouTube won't be around

293
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,040
 for that many more years.

294
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,440
 But yeah, how are you doing?

295
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,000
 - YouTube is forever tech, man.

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,880
 - Man, nothing's forever.

297
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,720
 - What's going on YouTube off the throne?

298
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,200
 - Themselves.

299
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,040
 - Okay.

300
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,960
 - I mean, you look how they treat their creators.

301
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,880
 The people who actually make the platform great.

302
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,880
 I remember when I first started YouTube in 2006,

303
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,840
 that's when I joined YouTube.

304
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,560
 It was no mainstream media bullshit.

305
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,560
 It was none of these like these major corporations,

306
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,280
 like the shit was the wild, wild west, man.

307
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,600
 - Well, it was more fun.

308
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
 It was better.

309
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,280
 You actually had--

310
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,080
 - YouTube and LiveLeak.

311
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,640
 That was really the two that I remember.

312
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,960
 LiveLeak was extra wild,

313
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,880
 and then YouTube was like a little more chill.

314
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,760
 - Well, it became more commercial.

315
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,120
 And as a result, the content is not as interesting.

316
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,880
 In general, there used to be like a lot of fun stuff on YouTube.

317
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,240
 And then, you know, I've watched over the years,

318
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,800
 you know, how it changed,

319
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,000
 especially when they started doing the ad stuff.

320
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,760
 And of these companies are now telling YouTube

321
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
 the kind of content that they are going,

322
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,920
 that they're willing to have on their platform.

323
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,560
 But it's like the thing that made the platform worthwhile

324
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,640
 were the users who were creating the content.

325
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,160
 So it's just like, this weird thing with advertisers,

326
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
 where it's like, y'all come in and fuck up everything.

327
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
 Like, you go into a space where people are

328
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
 because they've made it great.

329
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,640
 And then you're like,

330
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,440
 well, we want to have this technical agenda

331
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,760
 that's kind of messaging.

332
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,200
 And then they've ruined it.

333
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
 And then you get back.

334
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,200
 - So I got a question for you real quickly,

335
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,200
 'cause you're way more into the tech area than me.

336
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,960
 Does it cost these services money

337
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,560
 for you to live stream, right?

338
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,920
 Like per, you know, like whatever server

339
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,400
 is like costing them, right?

340
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,520
 - Yeah, it's costing them a lot.

341
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,280
 And I'm actually, that's part of the reason why I'm streaming.

342
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,240
 I should start streaming at 4K to cost them more money.

343
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,040
 - Right, so I'm like, so they're,

344
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,600
 they gotta be losing a lot.

345
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,440
 Well, I know Twitch, that's why Twitch is just losing

346
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,960
 their hemorrhaging money.

347
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,680
 'Cause they got, you know, they got so many people streaming

348
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,680
 and they're not bringing in, you know, subs or,

349
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,240
 what else do they use over there for money?

350
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,880
 - I think it's like subscriptions.

351
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,360
 I think that's what they do.

352
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,040
 They have like some type of chat thing that you could do.

353
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,320
 So yeah, a lot of them are just costing Twitch money.

355
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,720
 And yeah, I don't know, man.

356
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
 I don't know.

357
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,160
 I have a conversation with one of my good friends

358
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,880
 the other day about the other one.

359
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,160
 What's the green one?

360
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,680
 They gotta F1 team now.

361
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,000
 - Is it kick or?

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
 - Yeah, kick, kick, kick.

363
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
 I was gonna call it steak, but steak is not,

364
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,520
 steak is like the gambling thing.

365
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,520
 Kick is like the, I guess it's an umbrella.

366
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,680
 So steak is maybe under-

367
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,000
 - Well, it's hard to tell these days.

368
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,440
 It seems like online gambling and streaming

369
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,840
 are going hand in hand these days.

370
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,720
 - Right, right, right.

371
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,000
 Yeah, so they're one and I just called them the same.

372
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,280
 They're kicking steak.

373
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,720
 But yeah, they got, I don't know who's bank rolling them, man.

374
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,760
 That's what I wanna know.

375
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,520
 I wanna know who's bank rolling them.

376
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,800
 Like we know who's behind-

377
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,040
 - We can figure it out.

378
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,120
 - YouTube now and we know who's behind Twitch.

379
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,960
 But who the hell is bank rolling?

380
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,120
 Kick steak.

381
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,080
 And why do they have an F1 team now?

382
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,920
 - It's all marketing.

383
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,760
 - How can they just-

384
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,600
 - It's like marketing.

385
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
 That's really all it is.

386
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,160
 If you're thinking of Red Bull, for instance,

387
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,840
 like they're the kings of marketing.

388
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,160
 You know, Red Bull has, you know, they have the F1 team.

389
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,920
 - Yeah, but I mean, they have product that's like,

390
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,040
 known and used. - But one like a drink.

391
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,480
 - Yeah, I mean, everybody knows Red Bull, man.

392
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
 - Well, that's why.

393
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,240
 - It's like, you got two options.

394
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,800
 You got Red Bull or you got Monster.

395
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,760
 - Well, I mean, people know Red Bull because of the marketing.

396
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
 Like they've done the marketing.

397
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
 I think a lot of these companies,

398
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,200
 like they rely on the marketing and the hype,

399
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,160
 all that kind of stuff to get traction, to get users.

400
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,640
 And if you do it long enough,

401
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,600
 eventually you'll hit a critical mass

402
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
 where, you know, you have the people there

403
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,640
 because you have the mindset.

404
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,480
 So it's thing about like videos,

405
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,760
 when you think about user creative videos,

406
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,600
 the first thing that comes to your mind

407
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,880
 is most likely YouTube.

408
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,840
 It's because they have the mindset.

409
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,960
 Now they didn't do it with marketing.

410
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,560
 It was, you know, people like me in the past

411
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,000
 who made the platform great,

412
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,440
 whereas these other platforms,

413
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,520
 they can't compete with that

414
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,000
 because YouTube is already entrenched.

415
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,800
 So they have to.

416
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,040
 - Yeah, I just, I want to know,

417
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,440
 I want to know how they're signing like,

418
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,880
 just crazy deals, man.

419
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,120
 Crazy deals.

420
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,200
 Eight finger deals for streamers and shit.

421
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,480
 - Well, yeah, yeah.

422
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
 - Yeah.

423
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,960
 - Well, look at it this way.

424
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,640
 Let's say you have a hundred million,

425
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,600
 not even, but let's say you have half a million users

426
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,040
 who are like coming to your stuff

427
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,520
 and you have the metrics showing

428
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
 that they're consuming this content

429
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
 and they're watching these ads.

430
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,120
 I mean, brands are willing to pay a lot of money

431
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,880
 to get in front of users.

432
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
 I mean, it seems like, I mean, granted,

433
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,360
 - Eight fingers, it's like,

434
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,120
 - Or not steak, not steak.

435
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,080
 - Kick, kick doesn't have ads.

436
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,400
 They don't run ads like Twitter.

437
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,240
 - I thought they do,

438
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,000
 I thought they are being bankrupt by the gambling stuff.

439
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,840
 - Yeah, okay.

440
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,680
 Okay.

441
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,960
 Well, then yeah, then that's where the money's coming from then.

442
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,520
 All right.

443
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,440
 I just don't want to be a dick.

444
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,280
 - I think so.

445
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,440
 - Yeah, I think so.

446
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,000
 Just like streaming and how it like,

447
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,200
 basically economics behind streaming.

448
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,120
 Like, how does it make money?

449
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,960
 How are people able to,

450
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,360
 or how a company's able to pay people

451
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,200
 so much money to do things?

452
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,040
 Well, it's not too many people

453
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,960
 who are making that much money.

454
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,040
 It's kind of like with movies where, you know,

455
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,880
 some movies.

456
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,200
 - Yeah, you got A-listers for sure.

457
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,840
 - Yeah, so I think that's what you're seeing is

458
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,880
 we see the headlines, oh, this one person,

459
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,280
 or maybe let's say 10 people who are making

460
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,480
 eight figures over a five year period.

461
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
 That's the part that you gotta keep in mind.

462
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,560
 It's over a five year period when you look at

463
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,880
 the present value of those dollars,

464
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,320
 it's not actually like 100 million.

465
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,480
 Or you said A-figures, I'm sorry,

466
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,240
 this is not 10 million.

467
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,480
 It's 10 million. - Yeah.

468
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,320
 - But you had to discount it for today over that time.

469
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,320
 Plus you had to put in the risk

470
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,840
 that the person may not actually pay it fully out.

471
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,040
 And that goes on both sides, right?

472
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,000
 So like, you know, the people who are paying it,

473
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,120
 they probably have some type of out clause

474
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,040
 where they can get out of the thing,

475
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,440
 out of the agreement where they don't have to pay

476
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
 the full amount.

477
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,000
 - Yeah, and so I'm pretty sure all of them,

478
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,960
 all signed like, I know you just said it,

479
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,320
 like the gambling, like they have to gamble on their stream.

480
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,400
 So they have to influence their following, like, you know,

481
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
 or like what they have to do.

482
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
 - That sounds like that whole work.

483
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,240
 That's what that sounds like.

484
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,480
 - Oh yeah, yeah, it's nasty, man, it's not.

485
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,120
 - Oh, you have to show the scene that destroys families.

486
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,320
 You have to show the scene that we know is morally bankrupt.

487
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,160
 And we'll tell you more.

488
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,520
 - What's worse is they're not gambling their own money.

489
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
 They're gambling.

490
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,680
 - Yeah, well, yeah, they're gambling the money

491
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,880
 that they're giving, but the people who are watching it

492
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,720
 don't know that.

493
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,840
 - Right, yeah, they're bankrolled by,

494
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,680
 yeah, they're playing with house money.

495
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,040
 So it's like they're laughing, having a jolly good time,

496
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,720
 you know, like when are lose?

497
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,960
 - Let's be fair though, like, I think that's the case

498
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,640
 for all gambling.

499
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,360
 So it's not new, it's the same.

500
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,040
 It's if you go to Vegas, it's the same shit.

501
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,680
 Like the house is always,

502
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
 the house is most likely gonna win

503
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,520
 because it's a business.

504
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,160
 They wouldn't be there if they didn't win, right?

505
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,480
 I mean, is that like,

506
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,680
 - It's the same where it's like the household

507
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,280
 who's wincing something?

508
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,120
 - Yeah.

509
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,120
 Well, since y'all are here, I guess I'll ask y'all.

510
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,360
 What do y'all, I don't know, what do you,

511
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,880
 should I just do this feature?

512
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,440
 I don't know what feature I'll do.

513
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,040
 I don't even know what, that's all I need to do.

514
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,440
 Or should I work on this?

515
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,160
 - I think last time we stopped on for the slack part,

516
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,160
 at least trying to add like, get tough off.

517
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,280
 - Oh, I'm just chilling 'cause it's Friday evening, man.

518
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,720
 I ain't really got much to do before I,

519
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
 I'll probably hit the gym in a little bit, but.

520
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,280
 - Yeah, I'm waiting on food.

521
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,880
 - Like, get some food and then, yeah.

522
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,120
 So I'll probably just be kicking it.

523
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,800
 I might mute in a little bit when that gets here.

524
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,440
 - I don't even know where, I mean, that's all,

525
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,200
 I mean, that's basically what these kind of are.

526
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,160
 So yeah, wait a minute.

527
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,840
 What was up, wait, oh, I'm tripping.

528
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,760
 I'm like, well, I'm on YouTube.

529
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,640
 I need to go to give up.

530
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,120
 Yeah, so we didn't actually start,

531
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,400
 we didn't start doing the, the off stuff for GitHub at all.

532
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,040
 I decided that it probably wouldn't worth it at that time.

533
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,200
 I don't even know if it's worth it now,

534
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,800
 but we'll see, let's see what else we gotta do.

535
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,680
 We'll go to,

536
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,280
 go to probably,

537
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,320
 and what is this app called?

538
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,480
 Watch the slack part.

539
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,500
 (soft music)

540
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,720
 All right.

541
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
 We'll go to our issues.

542
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,960
 Consider removing video tables.

543
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,480
 I've considered it, and I will do that eventually.

544
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,960
 And a great GitHub app, God damn it.

545
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,080
 I only have two things here.

546
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,160
 There's more that I need to do though.

547
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,080
 - But do you still do?

548
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,920
 Or do you remove the notes table?

549
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,360
 - No, I deleted the notes table.

550
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,040
 'Cause I actually could delete that

551
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,600
 because I didn't have any UI based on that.

552
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,440
 'Cause, all right, I guess let me back up.

553
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,400
 Even though this is a next app,

554
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,800
 and even though it all appears to be the same thing,

555
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,360
 and then the sense it kind of is, but it's really not.

556
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,920
 I have the API stuff, which is what I've mostly been working on,

557
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,160
 but then I also have this Jankaz web app

558
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,960
 near and then we pull it up like we start to add.

559
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,380
 (soft music)

560
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,400
 All right, so we'll come over here.

561
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,240
 What is that?

562
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
 Localhosts 3000.

563
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,480
 (soft music)

564
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,320
 All right, so here's the Jankie part.

565
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,400
 So it's like I have this part,

566
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,920
 and then there's this login page,

567
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,720
 and man, I really hope I can remember this password.

568
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,320
 It's like every time I do it, it doesn't work.

569
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,700
 (soft music)

570
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,040
 First song, nope.

571
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,360
 (laughs)

572
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,200
 Okay.

573
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,760
 Shit.

574
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,280
 Fuck, leave me alone.

575
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,360
 Fuck.

576
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
 Just, god damn.

577
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,440
 Oh my god, all right, man.

578
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,280
 - Wait, you forgot it?

579
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,600
 - No, it keeps fucking popping up,

580
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,840
 and it won't leave me alone.

581
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,720
 It like stills my focus from my keyboard,

582
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,120
 and I don't appreciate that,

583
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,560
 and I don't know how to turn it off.

584
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,400
 So.

585
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,820
 (soft music)

586
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,680
 - How are you?

587
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
 I'm back.

588
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,400
 You have to do a ton of this.

589
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
 - Oh, the Chick-fil-A?

590
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,520
 - Yes, sir.

591
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,840
 - Man, I haven't eaten Chick-fil-A in years.

592
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,480
 - It's all about that real chicken sandwich.

593
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,040
 - There's a Chick-fil-A like literally,

594
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,040
 like I can walk there if I really wanted to.

595
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,880
 (laughs)

596
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,760
 - I mean, it's not the best in the world, man,

597
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,040
 but I'm saying that, why not?

598
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,000
 And then cheat a little bit.

599
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,680
 - I can give you a good reason.

600
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,840
 - Oh, okay.

601
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,720
 - And then we pull up a receipt.

602
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,200
 - Cheetos.

603
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,520
 - Chick-fil-A.

604
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,240
 - That's good on the website.

605
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,400
 - We're going to bring up the sea turtles.

606
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,760
 - Who?

607
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,040
 - Thought you were going to say sea turtles.

608
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,960
 - Oh, I mean, we could, but it's worse than that.

609
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,680
 Let's see, it doesn't even have, okay,

610
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,200
 it doesn't even show it to you.

611
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,040
 Oh, no, it does.

612
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,880
 No, it doesn't.

613
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,680
 It doesn't show you the amount of,

614
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,040
 maybe I have to click on it.

615
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,960
 Show the full, they're hiding it from you.

616
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,680
 All right, let's look for so near.

617
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,040
 Here's why I don't fuck with that shit.

618
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,880
 (laughs)

619
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,720
 - The salt.

620
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
 (laughs)

621
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,560
 - I don't like you look--

622
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,400
 - I hate you.

623
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,240
 - I hate you, no.

624
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,520
 (laughs)

625
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,560
 - That is a lot of stuff.

626
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,040
 - And he over here, he's about to rethink it.

627
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,240
 He's like, oh my gosh.

628
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,200
 - Nah, hey, I'm gonna enjoy it.

629
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,720
 - I mean, you look like you're my complexion, bro.

630
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,640
 You gotta worry about the same hypertension

631
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,320
 and blood pressure that I gotta worry about.

632
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,160
 - That's a fact.

633
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,920
 - Yeah, so that's why I'm like, yeah,

634
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,080
 when I found out how much salt was in all this stuff,

635
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,560
 I'm like, yeah, I can't do it.

636
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,480
 Because I am at high risk for that.

637
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,240
 Like that diabetes, heart disease, all of that shit.

638
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,600
 So I'm like, no, screw it.

639
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,360
 I'm good.

640
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,120
 - No, that's good that you're looking out for that,

641
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,960
 for yourself, man.

642
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
 - Well, it's more so I hate them to die.

643
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,800
 That's really what it is.

644
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
 - Okay.

645
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,520
 - Sorry, well, yeah, best.

646
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,000
 That's why it's eat good, sleep good.

647
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,800
 You're a little of a relatively healthy life, I think.

648
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,280
 I don't really know.

649
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,120
 - I mean, we don't know about it.

650
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,440
 - I don't work out every now and then.

651
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,280
 - That's all I do.

652
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,120
 We all don't do it.

653
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,640
 - Let me, I'm gonna mute again though,

654
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
 but I'm checking out whatever you're doing.

655
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
 I just don't wanna be on the mic even.

656
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,200
 - All right, Yani.

657
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,600
 So what am I doing?

658
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,440
 - Yeah.

659
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,280
 - I don't know.

660
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,360
 - You were trying to show me the table you deleted?

661
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,200
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

662
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,520
 I can't show it to you, but yeah, it's deleted now.

663
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,600
 - Are you merged to the PR?

664
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,440
 - Yeah, yeah.

665
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,640
 Well, no, remember the table that's outside of GitHub.

666
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,920
 In a sense.

667
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,280
 All right, so like the table, like that's the database.

668
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
 And that has nothing to do with the code base.

669
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,360
 That's entirely separate.

670
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,000
 Now, there is something that's in the code base

671
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,760
 that is related to the table, and that's specifically the,

672
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,200
 oh, gosh, excuse me.

673
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,040
 Excuse me.

674
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,920
 That's the types.

675
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,720
 So let's say I go to this insert video function,

676
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,040
 and you see here how I'm able to do this public tables,

677
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,140
 videos row, that type right there.

678
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,000
 - Yeah.

679
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,160
 - And when I hover over that, you see all of the properties

680
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,840
 that are part of that type, as long as they're types.

681
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,320
 This is generated from the database.

682
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,960
 So that's the thing that's actually in source control,

683
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,920
 but this is generated from the database,

684
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,760
 not the other way around.

685
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,280
 So if I have these, if I have this type here,

686
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,800
 I can't just generate the database from that.

687
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,920
 And there are a lot of reasons why.

688
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,760
 I don't think I have any indexes.

689
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,840
 Yeah, yeah, I don't, yeah, I mean,

690
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,520
 I have this one index here, but there's no way for this

691
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,760
 to know like what indexes I would have to find,

692
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,560
 unless I, yeah, well, there's not really an unless really.

693
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,040
 But yeah, so it's like I can either do the all thing

694
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,040
 or probably a better thing to do is to get the trans coding

695
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,280
 stuff, get that part in place.

696
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,400
 So I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that in next land

697
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
 because I don't control the server.

698
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,080
 Yeah, whereas fortunately I do have infrastructure

699
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,880
 that I've been paying for.

700
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,840
 I don't have other infrastructure.

701
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,120
 And I'm sure you're aware of some of it

702
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,080
 that we can spin up a virtual machine

703
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,680
 and then we can send jobs to that

704
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,000
 where it can like go and do the processing

705
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 or, and this is a hack, but I'm happy to go this route.

706
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,760
 I can use actions.

707
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,160
 All right, so.

708
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,840
 I'm actually, yeah, let's do this.

709
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,280
 Well, here's the thing though, like when I say use actions,

710
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,880
 I don't mean I can use actions on github.com

711
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,000
 because I wouldn't be able to do that.

712
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,960
 There is a thing that action has,

713
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,040
 and let me see if I can show that right quick.

714
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,440
 So if you go into actions and you go to general and runners,

715
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,200
 there's a way where you can do a self-hosted runner.

716
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,440
 So I can essentially install the host on this Mac studio.

717
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,200
 I have one, actually have a host running in another house

718
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,440
 that I could send it to is a Mac mini though.

719
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
 It's not powerful enough to do what I need.

720
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,960
 So I can install a host for this particular repo.

721
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,320
 And then every time I submit a job,

722
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,280
 that job would essentially come to my computer here.

723
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,360
 And I can, I should be able to leverage,

724
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,240
 actually, now I don't think I would be able to do that.

725
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,040
 The only reason why I don't think I'll be able to do it

726
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,040
 is I think that these run in a in containers.

727
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,240
 And unless I can mount my disk,

728
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,080
 like my local, my local disk onto that,

729
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,720
 I don't know if that will work.

730
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,360
 But I don't know if we can explore that.

731
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,200
 We can see how far we get and see what happens.

732
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,640
 Let's see, let's go to about self-hosted runners

733
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,440
 and see what I would have access to.

734
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,840
 Customizing the containers.

735
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,680
 There we are.

736
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,120
 - Okay, but this is interesting because my first time

737
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
 even hearing about runners.

738
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,480
 - Oh. - So for those two runners.

739
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,320
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

740
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,280
 It's a thing. - Pretty cool.

741
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,080
 - Let's see, configuring,

742
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,880
 Customizing the containers, use my jobs, okay.

743
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,940
 Okay, I can prepare, clean up, run,

744
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,720
 prepare, call when a job is started,

745
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,040
 prone anything, create network.

746
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,800
 So, okay, so I can create a network.

747
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 That is useful to know.

748
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,320
 So I could, 'cause all of my stuff is on a NAS,

749
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,440
 it's all network anyway.

750
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,320
 So it's like, I could just establish a network

751
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,320
 to my NAS, to the drive or to a specific folder on my NAS

752
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,160
 that the content would be in.

753
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,200
 And maybe I should go do a quick overview of like,

754
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,880
 what it is that I'm trying to do, just do it manually.

755
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,400
 So let's go to, I'm gonna quit Xcode.

756
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,240
 You don't wanna do that right now.

757
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,360
 And if the people in the chat,

758
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,720
 if y'all are on the streams,

759
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,280
 y'all want to see Xcode, you should've said something.

760
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,880
 This how this works.

761
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,640
 You get nothing you don't ask for.

762
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,960
 (soft music)

763
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,960
 All right, let's open up Finder right quick.

764
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,400
 And we'll go to, what is it, volumes.

765
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,640
 And then, oh, it's not connected.

766
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,920
 Oh, okay, let's see, maybe I can force it to connect.

767
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,640
 Nope, all right, I'll have to connect to it manually.

768
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,920
 All right, there we are.

769
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,880
 Whatever, I'll just click on it now.

770
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,360
 (soft music)

771
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,760
 All right, so we will like make this different.

772
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,760
 All right, cool.

773
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,800
 So we look at Footage here,

774
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,800
 and let's go to one of these.

775
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,480
 And here, so this was a stream that I did at some point

776
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,000
 in the past.

777
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,240
 And I'm gonna play it.

778
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,200
 And maybe I need to turn off music for a little bit.

779
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,200
 Yeah, not with that.

780
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,320
 We're not gonna turn on music.

781
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,160
 We'll just have to go with it.

782
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,200
 So, is it playing?

783
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,120
 Okay, yeah, there it is.

784
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,400
 It took a second.

785
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,480
 All right, so there are a few things that I need to do

786
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,320
 in order to get my transcription

787
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,400
 and all that kind of stuff working.

788
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,640
 It's basically, I'm building a transcription service.

789
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,480
 And that's what I was like,

790
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,760
 I would need to set this up somewhere

791
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,480
 where it's like I have the processing power rock and do it.

792
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,640
 I don't wanna pay for it.

793
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,720
 I mean, I've already paid for it.

794
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
 I paid a shit ton of money for this in my studio.

795
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,160
 So it was like, I could use that.

796
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,720
 This would not scale if I wanted other people to use this,

797
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,640
 but at this point, I don't know if I care.

798
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,320
 This is mostly for me.

799
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,880
 So let's come here and we'll take this video, for instance,

800
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,880
 and we'll just open up a new terminal, put it up here.

801
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 And let me open up my notes.

802
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,200
 (keyboard clicking)

803
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,720
 We'll go into volumes.

804
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,800
 Come on, come on now.

805
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
 Goddamn it.

806
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,920
 I don't wanna see, this is what I mean,

807
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,960
 where like, things will just pop up

808
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,760
 and still focus from what the fuck I'm working on.

809
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,280
 First of all, I didn't even open up Cydian on this monitor.

810
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
 I opened it up on this monitor over here.

811
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
 - Is it like a bug or something?

812
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,440
 - I don't know what it is.

813
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,200
 It's obviously the world's most valuable company.

814
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,840
 Obviously they have the best engineers.

815
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,920
 That's what it is, what else could it be?

816
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,400
 Like, I opened it on this monitor

817
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,480
 and then I'll go over to here to do some work.

818
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,640
 And then it pops up over here while I'm doing work

819
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,000
 and it's still so focused on what the fuck I'm doing.

820
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,080
 - The scrubs, like the work, yeah.

821
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,560
 - This wouldn't be a problem if apps open instantly,

822
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,400
 like they did in 2008, on inferior hardware.

823
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,600
 Yeah, I used to have things that would open instantly

824
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,360
 and now it's just like things just take forever to open.

825
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,760
 I'm just like, which is interesting.

826
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,320
 - It's not that interesting.

827
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,160
 - It's not interesting.

828
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,000
 - I know why.

829
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,840
 - It's not interesting.

830
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,680
 - I know why.

831
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,520
 - You see if you think about it.

832
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,440
 We do have faster machines though compared to--

833
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,320
 - Yeah, but the reason why it's not interesting

834
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,520
 is because we also have worse software engineers.

835
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,240
 We actually have software engineers

836
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,800
 who don't understand how a computer works.

837
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,680
 Just saying.

838
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,200
 Like most of them have no clue how computers work.

839
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,720
 There's this mindset that you don't have to care

840
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,640
 about performance or speed or optimize your code.

841
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,920
 There's this idea that we should just program

842
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,320
 in the easiest to use languages,

843
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,720
 the easiest to learn languages.

844
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,400
 That's what I see a lot from the new people.

845
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,440
 It's just like, oh, well, what's the easiest?

846
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,440
 It's like, do you want your users to be pissed off?

847
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,200
 Do you want me to punch you in the face?

848
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,960
 Because that's kind of what I want to do

849
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,440
 and I'm using some of this shit where it's just like,

850
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,320
 come on, why is it this slow?

851
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,840
 I'm saying this is someone who built an electron app.

852
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,160
 It opens fast, it's fast.

853
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,960
 I'm pretty sure most people even know

854
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,000
 that's the best of an electron app.

855
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Anyways, I'm going into content.

856
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 We'll go into footage and we'll go to this year, 2024.

857
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
 I have other years that I need to start doing

858
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,680
 but I just haven't had the time.

859
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,440
 I have a video catalog that goes back to 2006.

860
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,160
 So I would like to have all of that here.

861
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,960
 All right, we'll go into February.

862
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,800
 All right, cool.

863
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,280
 So here's all of the things.

864
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,080
 Now we could grep this but we're not.

865
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,400
 I see what I want here.

866
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,040
 So here's what I want to do.

867
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
 There's a couple things that I want to do.

868
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,160
 One is I want to create a folder or something.

869
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,440
 Like a, I don't know, like something.

870
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,840
 Let's just create a folder on my desktop for now.

871
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,480
 We'll call this processed.

872
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,200
 I'm processed.

873
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,360
 - And scrapped. - I don't know

874
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,200
 what to call it.

875
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,040
 - Transcribed bids for something I don't know.

876
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
 - I don't know either.

877
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,480
 - I think it's like the final product, right?

878
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,000
 After we transcribe it.

879
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,080
 - No, no, no.

880
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,480
 It's just going to be,

881
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,360
 this isn't a transcription at this point.

882
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,520
 That's what I'm showing.

883
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,480
 Like there's a few things that have to happen

884
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,640
 before I can even do a transcription.

885
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,920
 - Got you, Trent. - Okay.

886
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,640
 So let's, well, first we'll do this.

887
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,080
 We'll say processed audio.

888
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,000
 We'll call it that.

889
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,800
 Okay.

890
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,080
 Now I have a program on my machine,

891
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,000
 Socks, in Socks.I.S.O.X.

892
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,520
 and S-O-X-I.

893
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,920
 And we'll say it's sound exchange.

894
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,280
 That's what it means.

895
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,200
 And it's like, what they say is it's a Swiss Army knife

896
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,040
 for audio manipulation and all that kind of stuff.

897
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,600
 So they're all kinds of things that you could do with it.

898
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,880
 They're really helpful.

899
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,240
 They have a website too.

900
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,720
 I'll pull up the website so that

901
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,640
 you can read it a little bit easier.

902
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,000
 No, it's not good.

903
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,480
 Yes, it is actually on source forage.

904
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,880
 Do you even know about source forage?

905
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
 Do you know about source forage?

906
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,400
 - That's what the freak is this?

907
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,880
 - You don't know what source forage is.

908
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,720
 Wow.

909
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,560
 Okay.

910
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,760
 So before GitHub, there was source forage.

911
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,560
 In fact, GitHub was created because source forage

912
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,480
 had limitations, it didn't work with GitHub at the time.

913
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,400
 So our founders, they built GitHub.

914
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,040
 And yeah, so source forage,

915
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,400
 you can think of it as like the original GitHub.

916
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,520
 It's the thing that influence GitHub,

917
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
 except GitHub is built on GitHub,

918
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,640
 whereas this can be anything.

919
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,280
 Now, I did look to see if they migrated at some point

920
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,480
 in GitHub.

921
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,160
 This was years ago, let me see.

922
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
 I'm actually interested to know

923
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,240
 if they migrated to GitHub at all.

924
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,760
 Oh, look at that.

925
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,600
 Look at that.

926
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,440
 - I'm good, man.

927
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,280
 - Under whoever this person is,

928
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,680
 orick.

929
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,520
 - Oh shit.

930
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,680
 - Oh, well, okay, nevermind.

931
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,200
 It looks like it's, yeah, all right.

932
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,360
 I don't know if they're actually, yeah,

933
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
 they don't have the issue board,

934
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,400
 so they're actually still using source forage,

935
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,520
 for issues and shit.

936
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,360
 Which makes sense, I guess.

937
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,160
 - 16 years ago, Jesus.

938
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,600
 - Oh, are you surprised that we had software back then?

939
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,520
 - I understand.

940
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,360
 That's a long time ago.

941
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,200
 - That's when I started.

942
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,280
 That's when I started, it was 16 years ago.

943
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,080
 - So, you started way, way.

944
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,000
 - What, you talking about programming?

945
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,840
 - Yeah.

946
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,000
 - I wrote my first program 16 years ago.

947
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,920
 - Oh, yeah.

948
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,560
 - So it don't feel that long ago to me,

949
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,640
 it's what I'm trying to say.

950
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
 Like you're just young.

951
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,560
 What's that two thirds of your life?

952
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,760
 Something like that.

953
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,600
 - Yeah.

954
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,720
 - All right, so yeah, we have it here,

955
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,320
 but apparently it's still,

956
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,800
 it's actually still hosting on source forage.

957
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,560
 I imagine the bug tracker, yeah.

958
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,040
 So they use tickets.

959
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,960
 So if you ever heard developers talk about tickets

960
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,800
 and bug reports.

961
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,680
 - Yeah, yeah.

962
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,600
 - Well, yeah, it came from the good old days

963
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,640
 of that's what we used, and not issues, which,

964
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,120
 I prefer issues because they're more abstract

965
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,480
 from like a conceptually,

966
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,320
 where it can be anything, right?

967
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,440
 And I guess some people, they don't know what to do with that.

968
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,080
 It's like, oh, it's too powerful.

969
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,160
 I don't know what to do.

970
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,920
 They just become stuck.

971
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,560
 So an issue could be literally anything.

972
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,720
 It could be a bug report.

973
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,240
 It could be questions.

974
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,720
 It could be features, suggestions.

975
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,040
 It could be whatever you want it to be.

976
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,160
 It could be discussion around something, a topic.

977
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,800
 It could be planning.

978
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,880
 And I guess when people present it with a blank slate,

979
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,040
 people are just like,

980
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,440
 it shows who's creative and who's not.

981
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,360
 Who actually can do something and who can.

982
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,600
 Remember when I was saying how,

983
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,560
 if you started to write more often, it would become easier.

984
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,640
 - Yeah.

985
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
 - Oh, yeah, it could be easier.

986
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,960
 - Well, just imagine that there are some people

987
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,200
 who they see a blank page

988
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,240
 and they don't know what the hell it is.

989
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
 Right, so it's just like,

990
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,520
 - Yeah.

991
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,360
 - I don't know the thing,

992
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,560
 the gray matter between their,

993
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,000
 between their is just isn't working.

994
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,120
 It's not computing.

995
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,200
 It's not operating at the optimal frequencies.

996
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,560
 - Something. - I don't know.

997
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,800
 - Yeah, let's see what issues they,

998
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,800
 or I'm sorry, let's see what, what tickets.

999
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,000
 I'm just fucking down tickets.

1000
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,200
 - I see question number 272,

1001
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,400
 threshold parameter for silence filter is kind of correct.

1002
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,960
 And see, there's priority status open on there.

1003
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,040
 Nobody, wait.

1004
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,040
 - Well, it was created a couple months ago.

1005
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,320
 But to be honest, like, I bet you,

1006
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,600
 if this was on GitHub,

1007
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,840
 more people would probably commit like,

1008
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,000
 do stuff with it.

1009
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,920
 Like the fact that this isn't on GitHub,

1010
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,560
 I mean, they do have PRs, I did see that.

1011
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,240
 But let's see when, yeah,

1012
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,520
 open January 2023, 2022.

1013
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,240
 So it's like, I wouldn't even waste my time, bro.

1014
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,760
 Like what I would do,

1015
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,160
 if this wasn't working for me,

1016
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,320
 is I was straight up fork it

1017
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,200
 and just do my own shit and just say,

1018
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,280
 you know what, screw it.

1019
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,200
 They're not going to accept my upstream changes.

1020
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,040
 So why would I contribute?

1021
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,920
 - Yeah.

1022
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,840
 - Now this could use with better stewardship, I guess.

1023
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,040
 Yeah, no, nevermind.

1024
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,200
 This isn't C, I'm not going back to C, fuck that.

1025
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,400
 I will not go back to C.

1026
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,480
 - Ah, C.

1027
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,480
 - Or so, I would go back to C

1028
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,680
 before I went back to C++, like real talk.

1029
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,400
 I hate C++ with a passion.

1030
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,560
 You know, I've hated so much,

1031
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,280
 I'm willing to say a lot of on stream.

1032
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,160
 So if you're any, if anybody's like,

1033
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,720
 hey, we want you to do C#, C++, no, fuck that.

1034
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,560
 I'm good.

1035
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,160
 I'll do C.

1036
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,360
 - So game development, man.

1037
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,280
 - Well, if I don't play games, so, no.

1038
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,120
 - Yeah.

1039
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,760
 - I'm not about to waste my time.

1040
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,960
 I know some people like games.

1041
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,840
 In fact, one of my friends works at two cases,

1042
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,960
 he works at two games, no.

1043
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,080
 I think he's like a director or something.

1044
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,920
 - No, that's dope.

1045
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,760
 - Yeah.

1046
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,400
 I should actually hit him up.

1047
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,040
 I don't know if I would go there to do a game shit,

1048
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
 but I can do other stuff.

1049
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,040
 I can talk shit about game shit, so I can do.

1050
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,880
 All right, anyway, so let's look at this right here

1051
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,960
 and let's go through the fact that there is no read me.

1052
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,000
 So really the only way to know what it can do

1053
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 is to build it and then go and look at the man pages,

1054
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,120
 which is what I was doing here.

1055
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,440
 This is my tool for looking at man pages

1056
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,080
 that are on my machine.

1057
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,760
 So we can see what it does.

1058
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,880
 Can I zoom in on this?

1059
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,720
 Oh, look at that.

1060
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,560
 I don't even know how I can zoom.

1061
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,400
 This isn't it.

1062
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,040
 All right, so there's a few things

1063
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,920
 that are important to know about audio.

1064
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,120
 Oh, actually, before I do this, we can't do this first.

1065
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,520
 We can't do this first, I forgot.

1066
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,760
 So let's, where's my thing?

1067
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,400
 Here we are.

1068
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,120
 Yeah, so let's open up the metadata

1069
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,720
 for this last video here.

1070
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,840
 We'll go, wait, why does that not selecting?

1071
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,680
 What the hell?

1072
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,280
 Okay, so we'll open this with my media info app.

1073
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,280
 I can zoom in.

1074
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,840
 This is a straight up native Mac app.

1075
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,280
 And I don't know if you know,

1076
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,240
 but Mac OS doesn't really like to give you readable text.

1077
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,800
 It doesn't like to give you stuff that normal people can see.

1078
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,000
 If you don't believe me, just open up Xcode

1079
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,560
 and look at how tiny everything is.

1080
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,400
 And yeah, it's really silly.

1081
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
 I'm saying, working on my computers.

1082
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
 So Xcode doesn't work on your computer.

1083
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,440
 I mean, you should crash and stuff.

1084
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,760
 Well, no, it's working and that's what Xcode does.

1085
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,600
 What are you saying?

1086
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,040
 That's literally what it does.

1087
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,280
 Your experience, it went on experience.

1088
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,200
 Welcome to the club.

1089
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,160
 All right, so look here, this is the metadata

1090
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,800
 for the video aspect of this.

1091
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,360
 By the way, when I say video,

1092
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,360
 it's important to understand that video is a little weird.

1093
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,120
 Like within a video, there's the video,

1094
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,960
 which is why it's weird.

1095
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,800
 And then there's the audio.

1096
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,120
 The audio is optional.

1097
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,040
 So whenever you're looking at these like MOV, MP4,

1098
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,840
 these are containers that hold the video and audio

1099
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,520
 and all of the metadata that keeps them in sync

1100
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,320
 so they can play together.

1101
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,240
 And there may also be subtitles

1102
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,560
 and all that kind of stuff in the container.

1103
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,680
 So you'll look at this just to file.

1104
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,400
 Yeah, they're like, I mean, they're all,

1105
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,960
 it's in the same file that's all packed together.

1106
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,080
 But the file format, it actually has like a specification

1107
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,000
 for like where things are, how it's supposed to work.

1108
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 And this may be defined somewhere.

1109
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 Let's see, let's look MP4 file container.

1110
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,120
 Oh wait, why am I doing this?

1111
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,120
 Let's use Jima now, that BS at Google's over here doing.

1112
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,440
 Oh wait, Jim is that out?

1113
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,280
 Jima?

1114
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,160
 Well, no, they rebranded Bard that dumbass shit.

1115
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,560
 And they now call it Jima now.

1116
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
 They kind of tricked us.

1117
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,800
 No, I mean, they tricked you.

1118
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
 They ain't tricking me.

1119
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,200
 Don't put me in that.

1120
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,840
 Is there like a gem in a coming soon, but okay,

1121
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,760
 they just rebranded Bard?

1122
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,240
 I don't know, I guess.

1123
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,200
 Let's see if it even works.

1124
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:40,400
 Give me the specification for the MP4.

1125
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,120
 Man, I can't type MP4 video container.

1126
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,360
 I'll just say spec.

1127
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,680
 Already I'm not impressed.

1128
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,680
 Like what?

1129
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,240
 Yeah, it takes a little bit.

1130
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,040
 Ooh, okay.

1131
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,400
 I like how the resources.

1132
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,880
 We have to compare, I don't know.

1133
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,080
 We're gonna see.

1134
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,080
 Now it links the resources it used to bring up the output.

1135
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,640
 Wait, what the fuck?

1136
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,400
 Why, what?

1137
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,800
 Okay, all right, fine.

1138
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,680
 I'll just click the button.

1139
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,000
 Oh my gosh, I hate when things don't work

1140
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,040
 the way that they should.

1141
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,280
 All right, we're gonna go to Chad Jepity.

1142
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,080
 Jep-Jepity, Chad Jepity.

1143
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,680
 All right, we're just gonna copy the same thing.

1144
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,640
 Look at that lack though, my gosh.

1145
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,480
 What was there in life?

1146
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,400
 Of course there was like, for me, maybe I don't see it,

1147
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,640
 but like look as I highlight,

1148
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,000
 my hand was off the mouse and it caught up eventually.

1149
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,840
 Y'all do it again.

1150
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,040
 'Kay, you see my hand?

1151
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,880
 I'll do it again.

1152
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,800
 I guess you don't see it.

1153
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,760
 All right, so let's see,

1154
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
 which one gives me better info?

1155
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,480
 I'm honestly the right--

1156
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,840
 It's pretty much the same.

1157
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,960
 It's not the same.

1158
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,040
 Not entirely, but I think the only difference

1159
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,200
 that I see is like the structure.

1160
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,080
 That's the only difference you see?

1161
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:24,520
 I mean, added like a resources section where it like...

1162
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,680
 Well, one of them actually asked my question.

1163
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,520
 My question was,

1164
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,080
 or my, I guess my demand, my command is,

1165
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,680
 give me the spec for the MP4 video container.

1166
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,800
 This is the only one that actually does it.

1167
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,400
 I don't see the spec here.

1168
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,600
 I see a half, I see a portion of it with this right here.

1169
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,240
 Like, but this isn't really it.

1170
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,320
 This isn't an answer to my question.

1171
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,040
 I'm really good at, you know,

1172
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,040
 sus now whether or not my questions are answered.

1173
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,240
 Let's just, you know, you know,

1174
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,720
 I have a really good BS filter where it's just like,

1175
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,040
 yeah, you give me some information,

1176
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,080
 you've said some words,

1177
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,640
 but they're not relevant to the thing

1178
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,720
 that I actually wanted to know, which is this right here.

1179
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,080
 So I want to know the spec.

1180
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,480
 So here's the spec and now I can go and Google it.

1181
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,800
 All right, so here it has the structure.

1182
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,320
 So this is why I would like to know the name of the spec

1183
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,960
 so I can go and Google it and go see information.

1184
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,640
 And if you want to learn more about this,

1185
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,520
 you can go, you can go, now you know the spec,

1186
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,680
 you can go look for it.

1187
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,000
 And I'm pretty sure that this has some things

1188
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,040
 that you can go and look at to learn even more.

1189
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,360
 They keep, I don't understand why it's going to Wikipedia.

1190
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,120
 Does it actually talk about the actual,

1191
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,000
 like how the file is built?

1192
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,840
 I don't know if I see that.

1193
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,680
 Anyway, so now we know the spec and we now understand,

1194
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,680
 hopefully you understand that MP4 is a container for video.

1195
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,200
 It's not actually like, for video, if that makes sense.

1196
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,560
 All right, so let's go back to here.

1197
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,840
 And what I need to do is I need to pull out the audio track

1198
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,880
 because the transcription that I need to do,

1199
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,560
 it's based on audio.

1200
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,960
 I can't say here's this video container and be like,

1201
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,920
 oh yeah, do the thing.

1202
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,080
 It needs to be in a very specific format.

1203
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,240
 It needs to be in wave format,

1204
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,040
 which is another way of saying PCM,

1205
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,600
 which is pulse code modulation.

1206
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,080
 I'm familiar with that, either of you.

1207
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,680
 PCM, PCM audio.

1208
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,680
 I don't know.

1209
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,320
 Are you familiar with AV stuff?

1210
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,480
 Like, you know, back in the day you had those receivers.

1211
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,640
 And then like, they had to pay a music theory class

1212
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,040
 when I was in high school.

1213
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,600
 Oh, what music theory that that's different.

1214
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,960
 So yeah, I know about MIDI control,

1215
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,360
 though, know about nothing else.

1216
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,080
 And y'all learned that in theory and for music theory?

1217
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,880
 Yeah.

1218
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,240
 Oh, wow, that's typically like audio technology.

1219
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,720
 No, it was real. Yeah, it was real dope, man.

1220
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,480
 Yeah. Oh, that's what that's another thing that was always

1221
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,800
 interested in when you started talking about going into audio.

1222
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,200
 I'm like, because yeah, it was cool back then.

1223
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,440
 I was in like band and then I just like.

1224
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,840
 Did you go to the band camp?

1225
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,920
 Into into.

1226
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,120
 Yeah, you did a band camp in the summer.

1227
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,120
 I did the band camp.

1228
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,480
 That's my favorite American pop movie just that.

1229
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,480
 That specific one, the band camp, the flute.

1230
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,520
 You remember the flute?

1231
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,680
 Wait, how old are you?

1232
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,560
 Are you? Are you? Are you the same age?

1233
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,320
 Yeah. OK. All right.

1234
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,160
 Yeah.

1235
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,040
 Yeah, I remember the band camp, the flute.

1236
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,280
 Like I low key.

1237
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,000
 I low key.

1238
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,440
 I was like, man, she kind of fine.

1239
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,520
 The red hat girl, I forget her name.

1240
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,200
 100% whoever she was.

1241
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:42,760
 What's her name?

1242
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,160
 I need to know.

1243
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,320
 No idea.

1244
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:45,840
 I'll see.

1245
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,840
 I don't know either.

1246
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,600
 We both got powerful computers in front of the emotional scene.

1247
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:49,960
 I don't know.

1248
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,360
 I don't feel like mom's powerful right now.

1249
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,880
 I was over here lagging and chugging, like struggling and shit.

1250
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,800
 American pop.

1251
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,960
 She was on the how I met your mother, too.

1252
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,600
 She looked different.

1253
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,240
 Sure was.

1254
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,920
 But I was still like, it was in the style.

1255
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,880
 You know, I was like, you know, I was like, Allison Hannigan.

1256
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,760
 Oh, Allison.

1257
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,040
 Oh, yeah.

1258
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,440
 She looked.

1259
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,680
 Yeah, she looked like a Hannigan.

1260
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,280
 Yeah, man.

1261
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,120
 Hold on.

1262
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,080
 Let me let me pull her up.

1263
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,880
 I guess it's her now.

1264
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,400
 Let's see what she looked like in American pie band camp.

1265
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,640
 The best one of them all.

1266
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,200
 She wears images.

1267
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,200
 How can Google so hard to use these days?

1268
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,000
 Hopefully I don't get banned from it from YouTube for showing a goddamn picture.

1269
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,520
 Yeah.

1270
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,600
 Yeah, this her right here.

1271
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
 Never know.

1272
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,560
 Oh, OK.

1273
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,840
 Man, she looks way different.

1274
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,800
 She could have got it back.

1275
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,200
 And I'm going to see.

1276
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,720
 Yeah.

1277
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,520
 I was like, I was definitely 20 years ago.

1278
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,480
 Yeah.

1279
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,000
 Let's see how she looked and how I met your mother, which was what 10 years ago, I think.

1280
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,480
 Which was a good show.

1281
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,040
 If y'all never seen it, you should look at it.

1282
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,360
 I've never seen it.

1283
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,880
 Oh, wow.

1284
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,760
 Has nine seasons.

1285
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,200
 Well, yeah, yeah.

1286
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,320
 I show kind of drag going too long.

1287
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,120
 I enjoyed it though in the beginning.

1288
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,000
 I mean, I still enjoy it.

1289
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,440
 You know, I still.

1290
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,400
 Yeah, I enjoy it in the beginning.

1291
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:17,920
 Yeah, bro.

1292
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,440
 Oh, man.

1293
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,960
 And she could still get it, bro.

1294
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,440
 It was a life.

1295
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,560
 What?

1296
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,800
 What you over here?

1297
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,040
 What?

1298
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,120
 I see you over here blushing.

1299
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,240
 You know, why you always blushing?

1300
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,480
 Yeah.

1301
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,320
 Man, what are you doing?

1302
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,880
 You don't hear distracted.

1303
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,360
 No, I'm just saying she's she.

1304
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,320
 What you saying?

1305
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,520
 No, what you saying?

1306
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,320
 It's just she's not as.

1307
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,720
 Well, you guys, I don't know.

1308
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,560
 I just know they don't know.

1309
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,960
 I need to keep an NPC, man.

1310
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,640
 I don't know.

1311
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,040
 I'm not.

1312
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,080
 We got to help.

1313
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,800
 We got to keep a PC who do.

1314
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,760
 I don't.

1315
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,320
 I'm a I'm a free man.

1316
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,920
 You know, like as far as I know, after the

1317
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,080
 emancipation proclamation, I became a full

1318
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,840
 fledged American citizen and my birth

1319
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,160
 right is free speech.

1320
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,320
 I will not take that for granted.

1321
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,720
 Now, Yani on the other hand, it's not your

1322
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,320
 birth right.

1323
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,800
 But once, you know, eventually, you know,

1324
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,840
 when you get that citizenship, you know,

1325
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,640
 hopefully you'll hopefully we'll still have

1326
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,640
 that right.

1327
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
 I hear that they're trying to take away our first

1328
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,640
 amendment.

1329
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,640
 You know,

1330
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,640
 they turn.

1331
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,240
 Yeah, but I'll take that shit seriously because,

1332
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,480
 you know, you can't take for granted.

1333
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,240
 The second that you decide to do politically

1334
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,240
 correct, which by the way, that comes from Russia.

1335
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,040
 That's communist shit.

1336
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,320
 That's the Bolshevik revolution, where it's

1337
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,840
 like politically correct, where it's like,

1338
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,800
 instead of being actually correct,

1339
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,640
 you do something that's politically correct,

1340
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,840
 which is generally wrong.

1341
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,840
 So yeah, I don't play that over here.

1342
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,200
 So you'll get to know that about me.

1343
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,880
 I say what's on my mind, generally,

1344
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,280
 for the most part and consequences be down because

1345
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,880
 the consequence of me not saying what's on my

1346
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,880
 mind is literal hell.

1347
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,160
 Like, you know, like I have to live with myself,

1348
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,120
 which, yeah, I care more about how I feel about

1349
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,840
 myself and how other people feel about me.

1350
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,200
 And that's just due to the nature of

1351
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,160
 as far as I know, no one else is giving me seven

1352
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,160
 figures.

1353
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,000
 It's just as far as I know.

1354
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,080
 I mean, if any of y'all who are watching me now,

1355
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,440
 if y'all have any of your money has ever ended up

1356
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,880
 in my account, like, maybe I would listen to you.

1357
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,640
 We care about your feelings.

1358
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,280
 But yeah, let's go and find out what we're

1359
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,080
 going to what we're going to try to do here.

1360
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,160
 So we have the video container and there is a

1361
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,520
 plugin, not a plugin, a program that we can use.

1362
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,480
 Hold on, before I go into that, I first have to ask.

1363
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,600
 Do they make them like this in Ethiopia?

1364
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,880
 I want to name them like this.

1365
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,840
 Oh, shit, I close it.

1366
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,320
 Goddamn it. Whoever her name is, Alison Hannigan.

1367
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,040
 Oh, no, no, wait, wait, let's say Ray better.

1368
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,080
 Wait, what?

1369
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,520
 All right.

1370
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,640
 I'm on the Yarnie Johannesburg, South Africa.

1371
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,200
 He's from the place you go.

1372
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,400
 This is the only place you go find those.

1373
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,240
 Wait, fine.

1374
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,760
 Well, no, they're Dutch.

1375
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,600
 Alison.

1376
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,280
 Well, not a hand again, though.

1377
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,920
 That's, you know, they're Dutch down there.

1378
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,080
 Hannigan is up in what is that?

1379
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,480
 Scott Scotland or Ireland or whatever the hell it is.

1380
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,400
 It's a little bit more.

1381
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,040
 Yeah. Yeah.

1382
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,000
 Give me a Ethiopian person who I should know.

1383
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,920
 I need to know now.

1384
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,440
 Um, what do you think?

1385
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,160
 Well, I don't know.

1386
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,640
 You can't.

1387
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:38,840
 Are you?

1388
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,920
 Wait, are you from Ethiopia?

1389
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,120
 Two?

1390
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,360
 No. Oh, no, this for Yarnie.

1391
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,520
 Because I'm like, I need to see what they like.

1392
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,000
 I was only honestly, Ethiopia, who was dope when I was there.

1393
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,280
 I was only there for a day, though.

1394
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,080
 I'm going to spend the most time.

1395
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,400
 I don't have specific names.

1396
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,560
 I guess you can go.

1397
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,560
 I don't like to.

1398
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,000
 Of course.

1399
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,600
 Who?

1400
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,840
 Who am I Google with?

1401
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,920
 I don't have a name like specifically.

1402
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,760
 I don't follow.

1403
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,520
 I'm just supposed to say Ethiopian.

1404
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,280
 Good looking girls.

1405
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,040
 Or I guess never know.

1406
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,600
 I don't know.

1407
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,680
 We'll move on.

1408
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,000
 You need to think about this for the future.

1409
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,240
 We're going to revisit this.

1410
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,760
 All right.

1411
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,000
 So let's do a let's look at the program that we're going to use.

1412
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 There's a program called FFmpeg here.

1413
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,440
 And I want to say they have a website too.

1414
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,680
 In fact, they yeah, they actually do have a website.

1415
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,600
 So we'll go to their website.

1416
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,440
 FFmpeg.

1417
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,920
 Work.

1418
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,200
 All right.

1419
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,600
 So here is the website.

1420
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,840
 It's beautiful, isn't it?

1421
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,760
 Get to see all of the things, all of the updates.

1422
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,520
 And they do a lot of updates.

1423
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,280
 They keep this thing up to date for real.

1424
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:40,840
 And.

1425
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,400
 This is like witchcraft.

1426
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,520
 Let's look at their dogs, which crafts.

1427
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:45,720
 Yeah.

1428
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:51,160
 FFmpeg is so I've been using this kind of for.

1429
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,080
 Oh, wait, we actually have a lover of FFmpeg.

1430
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:55,480
 Wow.

1431
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,240
 Right.

1432
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,320
 That's impressive in chat.

1433
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,840
 Yeah.

1434
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,320
 Yeah.

1435
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,600
 He's like understanding the options is impossible.

1436
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,280
 It's possible with with with enough time and effort and head man.

1437
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,880
 But what I found is that you have to understand video

1438
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:19,400
 and audio to kind of wrap your head around and or FFmpeg as well as how we do

1439
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,280
 computer graphics.

1440
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,880
 Like it's a lot of different things that you need to know in order to get the most out of this.

1441
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,840
 But yeah, you see here, they have the command line tool, which is literally called FFmpeg.

1442
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,680
 And they have all these different things that you can do back when I used to do this in the past.

1443
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:41,000
 I was mostly concerned with muxars and demuxars as well as the filters.

1444
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,800
 I'm not saying I was good at it.

1445
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,480
 I was shit at it.

1446
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,560
 I was trash, but no, I know what they can do.

1447
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,000
 So what we want to do is look at utilities right quick.

1448
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,480
 Oh, wait.

1449
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,000
 Oh, wow.

1450
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,360
 They have a audio resampler.

1451
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,720
 Maybe I don't need to use socks.

1452
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:01,880
 If I can resample my audio here, then I don't have to I don't have to shell out to two different programs.

1453
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,920
 So I'll need to look into that.

1454
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,160
 But let's look here.

1455
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,160
 So this is what their docs look like.

1456
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:07,920
 How does this look?

1457
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,480
 It looks.

1458
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:19,880
 Um, I don't know, like.

1459
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,920
 Just plain plain.

1460
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,000
 Yeah.

1461
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,360
 All right.

1462
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,040
 Well, what is this point to you?

1463
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,960
 What does that plane is right here mean to you?

1464
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,000
 No, I was in for it.

1465
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,360
 That looks like.

1466
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,400
 Well, you said it looks plain.

1467
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:50,480
 So yeah, but this is why it's unapproachable to some people is because it's like you have to understand a lot of different things and the way that you specify options is kind of.

1468
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,480
 It can be a little tedious and this is, you know, obviously, you know, you have all these options here.

1469
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:04,280
 Now a lot of people don't think of these things, but like 724 80, by the way, this is what you would call standard definition.

1470
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,680
 But the actual term for it is NTSC.

1471
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,120
 What is it stand for?

1472
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,400
 Some about North American.

1473
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:12,960
 I don't remember.

1474
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,640
 I'll see.

1475
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:19,320
 Like, I just know NTC and our NTSC and pal palace for the European people.

1476
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,160
 And I think the.

1477
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,960
 Yeah, that's where to.

1478
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,320
 The PlayStation one came in those two formats, the game.

1479
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,880
 All right.

1480
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,360
 Well, here you go.

1481
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,400
 It's just a random fact.

1482
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:38,440
 If you, you download emulators, you can get those NTSC or pal.

1483
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,400
 Yeah.

1484
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,000
 And most, most game systems, even today, they, they still use that.

1485
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,600
 Let's see.

1486
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,560
 Sorry, colleges.

1487
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,400
 OK, never mind.

1488
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,040
 Yeah.

1489
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:52,200
 Yeah.

1490
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:57,520
 So you can see here that like NTSC is used basically here in North America.

1491
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:06,560
 But pal is also used in North America and over here in Europe, except for what it says, this is France.

1492
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,160
 Is that France?

1493
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,600
 Wait, which one?

1494
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,720
 This green, this orange one.

1495
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,600
 I thought that was Turkey or something.

1496
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,640
 Well, that's not Turkey.

1497
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,440
 Like, what?

1498
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,680
 No, this is the UK.

1499
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:29,920
 Man, now I don't want to hear any shit from anybody who's having a chance.

1500
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,520
 Talking about like American, so no shit.

1501
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,280
 Spain is underneath it.

1502
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:34,640
 Yeah.

1503
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,880
 Spain is.

1504
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,160
 Well, you're an exception.

1505
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,680
 Man, I will.

1506
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,120
 Who's your name?

1507
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,360
 Well, it's, I mean, that might be my

1508
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,640
 geography is terrible.

1509
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,320
 Yeah, even he knew what you said.

1510
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,600
 Yeah.

1511
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,320
 You live right next to it.

1512
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,160
 Yeah, it's France.

1513
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,480
 I was like, that's not definitely not Turkey.

1514
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,000
 Turkey is.

1515
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,800
 I think this is Turkey right here.

1516
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,760
 And then this is Greece.

1517
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,040
 No, this might be Germany.

1518
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:58,560
 Maybe.

1519
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,520
 Yeah, don't quote me on that.

1520
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,120
 I actually don't know.

1521
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,320
 Germany touches France.

1522
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:02,960
 Then.

1523
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,000
 Yeah, this is Germany then.

1524
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,280
 And this must be Poland.

1525
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,920
 Or should we say East Germany?

1526
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,280
 I don't know.

1527
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,280
 I'm going to say, well, it's.

1528
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,160
 Or Poland.

1529
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,720
 We'll say that.

1530
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,760
 Yeah, let's see.

1531
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,240
 We got some.

1532
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,480
 Is this for your vision pro project?

1533
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,520
 No, at the moment.

1534
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,040
 This is no, this is for the bot that I'm creating.

1535
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,760
 The vision pro project, I haven't truly started an earnest yet.

1536
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,040
 I have the project shell kind of.

1537
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,440
 And I got to a point where I realized that I couldn't go any further with the

1538
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,000
 simulator.

1539
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,480
 So I got the device and then I got the device and realized that I couldn't

1540
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,560
 really go any further until I bought the developer strap.

1541
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,440
 And then I bought the developer strap and I'm just like, fuck this.

1542
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,000
 I haven't.

1543
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,160
 Could like hangs off.

1544
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,000
 It's just like weird.

1545
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,240
 So.

1546
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,160
 Yeah.

1547
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,840
 No, it's not for that.

1548
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,520
 ACM I have abstracted most of that out with VR and all that.

1549
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,480
 Wait, what are we talking about?

1550
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,480
 Are you talking about like the NTSC and the power stuff?

1551
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,040
 Oh, yeah.

1552
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,720
 See, Randall, he yeah, Randall, he knows he knew too.

1553
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,000
 He said, yes, his friends.

1554
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,440
 And he even says Americans horrible at geography.

1555
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,200
 I'm American.

1556
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,040
 I'm pretty, I'm pretty good with geography.

1557
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,520
 What you brought you, don't know is that it wasn't American who didn't know.

1558
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,040
 So they got you.

1559
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,840
 It wasn't an American.

1560
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,480
 Oh, shit.

1561
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,560
 Yeah.

1562
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:29,760
 I know my geography fairly well, mainly because I've been around.

1563
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,320
 So.

1564
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,040
 And I also have a globe and a map.

1565
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,520
 And those things they've existed that that old school technology, you remember

1566
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,040
 back in the day, you had a map.

1567
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,520
 We had a main color.

1568
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,600
 We had them without without borders.

1569
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,680
 We had on with borders.

1570
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,120
 We had topological maps.

1571
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,680
 Like all of that.

1572
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,240
 What you know about map quest, though, man, let's take it way back.

1573
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,000
 I don't know about my before before GPS, like printing out directions to get

1574
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,400
 somewhere.

1575
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,160
 So I I grew up with key maps.

1576
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,520
 So I never I completely skipped map quest.

1577
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,520
 And honestly, I barely used navigation as it is.

1578
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,000
 Like I'm a motorcycle person.

1579
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,960
 So it's like I kind of have to just know where to go.

1580
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:22,280
 So I will look at, no, I would literally look at a map and I can I can reason

1581
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:22,960
 about where I am.

1582
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,200
 Yeah, really real map then.

1583
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:25,680
 All right.

1584
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,360
 Well, yeah, and I mean, also you got a like flight maps.

1585
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,840
 If you're looking in like, no, that like it's, you know, mapping is a whole thing.

1586
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,280
 I'm not saying that I like it.

1587
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,880
 It's just I was I was exposed to it at a young gate.

1588
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,280
 So I know how to do all of that stuff.

1589
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,480
 But I also knew how to find my way.

1590
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,600
 No, just using the stuff around me.

1591
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,520
 For instance, when you look up, there's this thing called the sun and it happens

1592
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,640
 to do the same shit every single day.

1593
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,760
 It rises in the east and it sets in the west.

1594
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,160
 So if you look at where the sun is, you can read, you can orient yourself.

1595
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,440
 Or if you live in a certain places, you understand the weather and patterns

1596
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,560
 because you look at the sky every day, hopefully I do.

1597
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,800
 And you understand the direction that the wind typically blows.

1598
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,960
 And you kind of like juxtapose, juxtapose that with where the sun is

1599
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,520
 and you can figure out where you are just from that.

1600
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:23,080
 So I'm really good with just like knowing what direction I'm going

1601
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,640
 and what direction I need to go.

1602
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,960
 And I can figure it out from there.

1603
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,840
 Anyway, we're getting off topic from this FF Impact magic that we're about to do.

1604
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,240
 All right.

1605
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,080
 So there is a particular command that I want to run right now.

1606
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,600
 It's FF Impact.

1607
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,880
 FF Impact.

1608
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,840
 And I thought I saw that shadow.

1609
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,040
 Oh my God.

1610
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,280
 And we're going to do dash I and I want to show you all what this means.

1611
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,800
 So we'll go to FF Impact here.

1612
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,520
 And let's look for the dash I option.

1613
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:01,720
 This is why I love this tool, by the way.

1614
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,240
 It's easy.

1615
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:09,280
 Like when you have a lot of different actually, actually, I don't know if I like this.

1616
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,320
 I want to be, I want to put a regular expression here now.

1617
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,640
 But what's cool about here is that you can kind of see all of the stuff

1618
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,560
 within context so you can scroll through if you really wanted to.

1619
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,200
 And maybe you'll see dash I.

1620
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,120
 So yeah, that's probably what I should do.

1621
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,920
 If I were in my terminal, what I would do is I would do a grep.

1622
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,280
 And then I can say line starting with dash I because all of these flags

1623
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,280
 generally start the line.

1624
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,360
 So if you know that about a man file, you can use that to your advantage

1625
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,040
 and find things that you want because obviously I come like that's common

1626
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,520
 word or I'm sorry, common letter because it's a it's a vowel.

1627
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,840
 So if you just looked for I or even dash I like you're going to see all

1628
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,200
 these different things here.

1629
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,520
 All right.

1630
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,520
 Let's see if we can find that.

1631
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,800
 Maybe I'll just go here we are.

1632
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,320
 So it says URL input file URL.

1633
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,200
 Now I know that you all may be thinking that a URL is just for the internet.

1634
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,360
 That is actually false.

1635
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,800
 It is in the name uniform resource.

1636
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,720
 I don't know.

1637
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,160
 No, locate your thing of a UI which is different from a URL.

1638
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,120
 Now for most people, the words don't matter.

1639
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,440
 But for me to do because they are very different.

1640
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,200
 They do different things.

1641
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,600
 So uniform resource locator.

1642
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,800
 Yeah, look, yeah.

1643
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,600
 So this means that I can give it something like this.

1644
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,000
 Here's a URL.

1645
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
 Oh, gosh.

1646
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,680
 Oh, do you see that is lagging?

1647
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,000
 Yeah, there we go.

1648
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,040
 So I dislike here is a URL essentially.

1649
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,920
 And I obviously it's not a full URL.

1650
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,600
 Let's actually go to something else.

1651
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,080
 We'll go to this yaml file or we'll just use Swift.

1652
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,320
 So now we have a URL.

1653
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:50,400
 And if we were to read this URL, we'll do that right quick.

1654
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,600
 We get that.

1655
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,600
 So you're a reference to that.

1656
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,200
 All right.

1657
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
 I see.

1658
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,000
 So we'll go back.

1659
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,800
 Oops.

1660
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,320
 Oh, OK, I never even started to command.

1661
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,800
 So we'll do ffmpeg -i.

1662
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,600
 And then I need to give it the source.

1663
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,400
 That's what it says here.

1664
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,800
 Go up to here.

1665
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,400
 So you see ffmpeg, you give it options.

1666
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,080
 Optional.

1667
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,800
 That's what these are.

1668
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,400
 By the way, are y'all familiar with BNR or BNF?

1669
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,600
 I'm sorry, BNF.

1670
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,200
 Bower, knock his form.

1671
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,600
 No, OK.

1672
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,200
 Yeah.

1673
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:27,880
 OK.

1674
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,400
 All right.

1675
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,800
 Well, let's let's let's backtrack a little bit.

1676
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,800
 All right.

1677
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,400
 I don't know what they teach in school these days.

1678
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:36,800
 That's right.

1679
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,200
 I was about like, maybe you were learning in school, but I don't know.

1680
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:39,600
 Like I don't.

1681
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,600
 I don't.

1682
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,200
 Walk is misspelled it, but that's cool.

1683
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,000
 We'll figure it out.

1684
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
 Oh, come on.

1685
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,400
 That's not.

1686
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 BNF.

1687
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 That's not it.

1688
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,800
 Hey, right.

1689
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,000
 Here we go.

1690
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,800
 Back is newer now.

1691
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,400
 We're high for hell.

1692
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,000
 You say it.

1693
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,200
 So it's just right here.

1694
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,400
 You've maybe seen stuff like this, most languages.

1695
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,200
 If you, if you're building a program in language, for instance, when you're building your grammar,

1696
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,400
 the grammar is generally going to be in BNF form.

1697
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,200
 I see.

1698
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,800
 Are you familiar with that?

1699
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,200
 You study at CS.

1700
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,800
 Yeah.

1701
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,200
 I study at CS.

1702
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,400
 Are you, are you doing CS as well?

1703
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,200
 Or what do you do?

1704
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,400
 I'm me.

1705
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,000
 Oh, my, OK.

1706
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,600
 I'm going to your real engineer.

1707
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,000
 OK.

1708
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,400
 I'm just a fake one.

1709
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,800
 I pretend to be one when I'm in California.

1710
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,200
 I can't call myself an engineer here in Texas.

1711
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,800
 It's a, it's a license that you have to know.

1712
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,600
 You're a developer relations engineer, though.

1713
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:47,400
 Oh, I cannot call myself an engineer in Texas legally, legally.

1714
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,800
 I cannot call myself an engineer.

1715
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,000
 Oh, wait, why?

1716
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,400
 Because I live in Texas.

1717
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,600
 We have standards in our state, unlike other places where everyone could be an

1718
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:01,600
 engineer, you have support engineers, you have success engineers.

1719
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,600
 Wait, is there a thing called support?

1720
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,400
 Obviously, if I'm saying it, yes.

1721
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,600
 Yes.

1722
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,000
 What the hell you have?

1723
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,600
 Like you just say anything.

1724
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,200
 Success in the engineer at the end.

1725
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,600
 And it's in California.

1726
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,000
 You have that.

1727
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,800
 Whereas here we have actual standards in our state.

1728
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,120
 So to become a licensed engineer in our state, you have to first practice under

1729
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,400
 another licensed engineer for a couple of years.

1730
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,000
 And then you are able to sit for the license exam.

1731
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,400
 And then after a while, I think you actually can become an engineer.

1732
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,000
 See Texas engineering license.

1733
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,160
 And the reason why it's important is because there's this thing called

1734
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,200
 accountability that we have in our state.

1735
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,600
 So if you were an, if you're an engineer, you're generally responsible for

1736
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,400
 building things.

1737
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,200
 And someone needs to be accountable and make sure that you are going to do the

1738
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,080
 best job that you can, that you're going to do all of the things to make sure

1739
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,200
 that you're not going to kill people.

1740
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,600
 So yeah, so it's part of that.

1741
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,000
 So here it is, Texas Board of Professional Engineers.

1742
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,400
 So we can see that it's not just me over here saying shit.

1743
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,800
 Let's see.

1744
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,000
 Here are the big exams.

1745
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,800
 There's like an exam.

1746
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,800
 And yeah, so like there's a whole process to becoming an engineer.

1747
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,200
 And our state.

1748
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,000
 Well, yeah, I mean, that's.

1749
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,800
 Let's do.

1750
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:28,000
 I mean, maybe for me, it is because if I actually were to decide that I wanted

1751
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
 to become a real engineer one day, I can get this.

1752
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,400
 And now like, you know, unless you have this, certain companies won't be able to hire

1753
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,000
 you because they can only hire engineers for certain things.

1754
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
 I answer for you.

1755
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,400
 Hmm.

1756
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
 Yeah, just a little see a little fun fact.

1757
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
 But like you could just get that like working in an internship though, right?

1758
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,400
 Oh, well, I killed two birds of one stone.

1759
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,200
 Assuming you were working under an engineer.

1760
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,200
 Right.

1761
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:57,600
 Yeah.

1762
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:57,600
 Yeah.

1763
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,000
 And they have to sponsor you.

1764
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,200
 Okay.

1765
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:04,000
 So it's not just, yeah, I worked at an internship and I can do it now.

1766
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,400
 It's like that engineer has to sign off on you being able to do the thing.

1767
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,000
 So again, to make sure that, you know, you know, there's accountability here, which,

1768
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,600
 you know, I appreciate it.

1769
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,600
 Yeah.

1770
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,200
 Is it?

1771
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,800
 Yeah, that's all I can say.

1772
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,000
 Yeah.

1773
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,200
 Let me go ahead and go forward and go back to this BNF form.

1774
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:30,000
 So the reason why I wanted to bring this up is that, you know, if you understand this,

1775
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,800
 you can really, really, really easily make sense of, and I want to be clear this.

1776
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,600
 Where did where did the thing go?

1777
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,200
 This technically isn't Bauer, not, uh, nor form.

1778
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,200
 I have to help you say it's technically not that, but it works in kind of the same way.

1779
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,000
 So whenever you see square braces, that's mean, that means optional.

1780
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:57,800
 So you know, you have the option of using these flags and they can be many of them.

1781
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,800
 The input files here.

1782
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:05,600
 So you see here how it's in this, um, how it's in like, uh, like Carly braces.

1783
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,000
 You can have more than one.

1784
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,800
 So it's like, you know, it's telling you how you can structure the, how to structure the command.

1785
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,800
 All right.

1786
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,000
 So anyway, let's go ahead and drag, drag the, uh, the file that I want to convert.

1787
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,200
 Just that.

1788
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,200
 Ah, shit.

1789
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,000
 I shouldn't have did it this way.

1790
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,800
 I'm already in the directory.

1791
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,200
 So I don't want to name it fully.

1792
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,800
 I'll just name it this way.

1793
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,000
 24, 24.

1794
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,600
 Three.

1795
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:32,800
 All right.

1796
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,200
 There we are.

1797
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,900
 All right.

1798
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,000
 So, uh, that's the source.

1799
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,600
 Now, if you go back to the option here, which I've already lost.

1800
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:47,400
 Where is the, okay.

1801
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:47,800
 Here we are.

1802
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:56,800
 Um, I don't know why I know that this has a destination file.

1803
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,900
 Oh, never mind here.

1804
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,900
 That's why I know because I was literally looking at it.

1805
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,200
 So you see here, I put in my input file.

1806
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,700
 Yeah.

1807
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,400
 And it says here I can do dash.

1808
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,300
 I input file.

1809
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,400
 This is an example.

1810
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:13,200
 What this is saying is that you have flags and then you can give a file.

1811
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,400
 And then, you know, this dot dot dot means that you can do more of that.

1812
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:24,700
 And then this next one is the output and this is giving you like, uh, like how it, how it expects the output to be named.

1813
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,600
 In this case, it needs to be a URL.

1814
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,800
 Same thing.

1815
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,900
 So we'll just give it a URL.

1816
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:33,300
 Remember, I created that, that passed on my desktop called process something.

1817
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,900
 Process audio.

1818
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,900
 That's my URL.

1819
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,400
 And then we need to give it a name.

1820
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:47,900
 So we'll say 2024, 02, 03, uh, audio, we'll call it dot wave.

1821
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,400
 I think.

1822
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,800
 Yeah, I think that's what I'm doing.

1823
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,600
 Hey, what am I doing?

1824
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,600
 I've already forgotten.

1825
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:55,900
 Yes.

1826
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:56,100
 Yes.

1827
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,100
 I'm converting this to wave.

1828
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:57,600
 Yeah.

1829
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:03,900
 So what's cool about F of impact is that it looks at the file extension to determine what it is that you want to do.

1830
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,900
 So you don't have to, you don't have to explicitly state.

1831
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,300
 What is that you would like to do?

1832
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:19,100
 So in this, because I have this movie file and the output is a wave F of impact, you know, the developers are like, they're infurring that I want to create a wave file and it can handle it.

1833
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:19,800
 So it'll just do it.

1834
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,700
 So we'll go ahead and do that and get a bunch of output.

1835
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,100
 It's going to take a little bit.

1836
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,100
 It's two and a half hours worth of video and audio.

1837
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:39,300
 It's actually going much slower.

1838
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:39,600
 Okay.

1839
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,400
 I was about to say I'm like, it hadn't even started.

1840
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,100
 I don't know why that took so long.

1841
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:48,200
 Yeah, you see here is showing you what the bit rate that is doing to that.

1842
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,200
 So it's like 1500 kilobits per second.

1843
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:57,200
 So, Yanni, you did enough CS to maybe know this.

1844
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:04,100
 What's the difference between bits and bytes and why do we use them or when do we use bits versus bytes?

1845
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:09,400
 It's like an A plus exam right now.

1846
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,900
 No, this one A plus is about hardware.

1847
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:12,500
 That's different.

1848
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:17,000
 Although it's both this both you get it a little bit, I think maybe.

1849
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,100
 Well, you must know if you know about a plus you know, when do we use versus bytes?

1850
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,900
 Well, but I don't know that use this versus by.

1851
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,600
 I know like one bit is like eight.

1852
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,200
 No, was it one byte is eight bits, I think?

1853
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,500
 Yes.

1854
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,500
 That part I do now.

1855
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,800
 But that's not what we use one or the other.

1856
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,200
 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1857
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,100
 I don't know when I'm sure you can think about it.

1858
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,500
 Like how much space do you have on your hard drive?

1859
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:52,400
 So that's 256 gig bytes.

1860
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,000
 There you go.

1861
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,400
 So why didn't you say whatever that is, Tom's eight bits?

1862
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,300
 Right.

1863
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,600
 Yeah.

1864
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,200
 Well, you know your answer.

1865
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:06,200
 Yes, I do use it for storage and file sizes.

1866
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,500
 We use bytes for that.

1867
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:12,100
 However, for networking for transferring things, we use bits.

1868
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:17,600
 So there's bits per second and then there's bytes per second.

1869
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:23,300
 And if you ever looked at internet speeds, they're always selling you on how many mega

1870
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,100
 bytes per second it is.

1871
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,200
 And they're like they don't so they use the capital B.

1872
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,700
 They do in capital B.

1873
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,100
 If you know anything, you'll know that that's like false marketing.

1874
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:37,000
 Most people don't know that capital B means bytes and lowercase B means bit.

1875
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:44,100
 So what you see something that's like, oh, your internet speed is 200 mega MB per second,

1876
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,000
 what you need to do is divide that by eight.

1877
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,600
 And that's what it is in and bytes per second.

1878
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,500
 I don't understand why people think in bytes per second because we generally we measure

1879
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,600
 transverse B is always in bits per second.

1880
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:03,400
 So it's a little bit of this ingenuity on the network.

1881
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,200
 The other networking side.

1882
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,900
 No, the ISP side.

1883
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,200
 Yeah.

1884
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,600
 Over here, advertising.

1885
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:15,300
 Just so like I have, I think, two two gigabytes per second, but it's really two gig

1886
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,200
 of bits per second.

1887
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:22,300
 So if you were to divide it by eight, it should be about 125 megabytes to 250 megabytes per second.

1888
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,900
 Yes, yes.

1889
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:31,200
 I am in D streaming on Twitter, YouTube Twitch might explain a little of the sluggishness.

1890
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:35,900
 It doesn't because I've been doing this for a year and it wasn't sluggish.

1891
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:41,100
 Tell him, youngie, tell him how amazingly fast it was just three months ago.

1892
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:41,900
 What happened?

1893
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,400
 Yeah.

1894
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,900
 I think he does it.

1895
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,300
 He will does have screen sharing on zoom.

1896
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,100
 So I think that used to do that too.

1897
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,500
 A year ago.

1898
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:55,100
 But ever since some zoom update, things started to slow down.

1899
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,300
 They hired a bunch of new developers.

1900
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,300
 That's what it was.

1901
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,000
 They're just like, why should we care about performance?

1902
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,100
 Or maybe they laid off all their good developers.

1903
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,000
 I heard they were going through layoffs.

1904
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,500
 That's why I see.

1905
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,100
 I know we're eventually I will do something useful in life.

1906
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,300
 Let's see layoffs.

1907
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,500
 I remember seeing zoom in here the other day.

1908
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,700
 No, it wasn't.

1909
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,100
 I thought it was Twitter or something.

1910
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,100
 I was going to lose been laying on people too.

1911
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:23,900
 How do not search?

1912
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,300
 Here it is.

1913
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,600
 Zoom.

1914
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,200
 Look at that.

1915
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,500
 150.

1916
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,800
 And oh shit.

1917
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,600
 That was this month.

1918
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,500
 Oh, that was eight days ago.

1919
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,200
 No wonder they should so trash.

1920
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,500
 They they letting go all of their people.

1921
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,400
 I don't know.

1922
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,000
 I'm just saying that they could they could be letting go non-engineers.

1923
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
 I don't know who they're letting go.

1924
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,400
 But yeah, they they've been going through layoffs often.

1925
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,500
 And this is not only one.

1926
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,600
 So let's see when the next one was.

1927
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,100
 All right.

1928
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,200
 So they did one last year in the same month.

1929
01:17:59,200 --> 01:17:59,400
 Wow.

1930
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,700
 It seems like they like to lay out people in February.

1931
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,500
 So if you're working at zoom.

1932
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:08,300
 It's February like you bought the blue show job like history month.

1933
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:08,900
 That's what it is.

1934
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:09,500
 They black.

1935
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,000
 Yeah, they did.

1936
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,600
 Oh shit.

1937
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,800
 13 hundred.

1938
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,900
 Oh my gosh.

1939
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,200
 Wait in total.

1940
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:17,700
 Yeah.

1941
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,100
 Yeah.

1942
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,700
 Oh, on or just one.

1943
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,100
 Oh, last year.

1944
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,100
 Yeah, last year.

1945
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:23,700
 Yeah.

1946
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,700
 It's like 15 percent like.

1947
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,200
 Well, I don't know how big it was.

1948
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:27,500
 It says.

1949
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,100
 Oh, 15.

1950
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,400
 OK, 15 percent.

1951
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,500
 Man, I didn't need it that many people to build zoom.

1952
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:37,200
 Yeah.

1953
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,300
 Look at that.

1954
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,300
 More, you know.

1955
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:39,800
 All right.

1956
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,500
 Let's go back to what we were doing over here.

1957
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,100
 All right.

1958
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,800
 So if I look into here, there should be my process audio.

1959
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,400
 Yeah, we are.

1960
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,900
 So let's take a look at it.

1961
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:55,800
 I guess we will first open this up in the directory here and open this with media info.

1962
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,400
 And we can get a fill for what this is.

1963
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,100
 So remember how it's like PCM PCM PCM PCM.

1964
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,400
 Well, here we are.

1965
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,600
 There we are.

1966
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,000
 Format settings PCM wave format.

1967
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,500
 So wave is just another name for PCM.

1968
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,100
 Which is the technique that we use for encoding audio, specifically the samples.

1969
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:21,800
 And I got a I got a ha ha apple maybe once you upgrade.

1970
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:28,600
 Yeah, honestly, I've been talking to Yani about this how like I'm probably going to upgrade to the M3.

1971
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,300
 Yeah, but I don't know.

1972
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:39,700
 Like I kind of want to wait for the M4 unless they unless they go to the new the N3 Eno, which is a little a little bit more efficient.

1973
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,200
 They have higher yields.

1974
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:42,800
 Unless they're doing that.

1975
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,600
 I don't I don't I would prefer to wait.

1976
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:53,100
 No, because every time they go to a new node process, there are things that they need to work out to make it no more efficient, better than all that kind of stuff.

1977
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:53,700
 But who knows?

1978
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,400
 Maybe I'll just say screw it and just give it.

1979
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,800
 I'm going to blow my budget for the year, bro.

1980
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,600
 Like that's that's it.

1981
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,500
 So I have a $10,000 a year apple budget.

1982
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:07,100
 That's why I'm like, I'm guessing because I just dropped 6K on the vision and accessories.

1983
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,200
 And then.

1984
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,300
 Yeah.

1985
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:10,800
 And like.

1986
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,100
 Let's look at what it's actually more.

1987
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:13,500
 What?

1988
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,500
 How about the second one?

1989
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,000
 What do you mean the second one?

1990
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,400
 That doesn't count.

1991
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,400
 I'm not that that's that's completely.

1992
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:19,600
 Yeah.

1993
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,100
 People even know I need to have another one like I don't have only have I have no vision pros.

1994
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:24,600
 I'm broke.

1995
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,400
 I don't have anything.

1996
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,100
 Don't listen to who.

1997
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,700
 Oh shit.

1998
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,000
 I can look at us here.

1999
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,800
 Oh, wait, no, I can stream ushers hit.

2000
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,800
 I don't like us here that much.

2001
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,500
 So.

2002
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,900
 Oh, the Super Bowl.

2003
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,700
 Oh, the Super Bowl.

2004
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,900
 Oh, yeah.

2005
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,300
 Yeah.

2006
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:39,800
 What's his name?

2007
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,500
 Was something about super?

2008
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,700
 I don't really do Super Bowl.

2009
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,400
 I don't either, man.

2010
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,000
 I don't know.

2011
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
 He's not a.

2012
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,900
 He can be football.

2013
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:46,900
 Americano guy.

2014
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:47,600
 Oh shit.

2015
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,300
 Yeah.

2016
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,900
 Like I'm witchy, bro.

2017
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,800
 Like it goes even deeper for me though.

2018
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:59,700
 It's just like, why would I want to watch other men make more money than me when I can be out there trying to make more money?

2019
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,100
 Hey, like I just don't get it.

2020
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,800
 You got a point, man, with that.

2021
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,800
 But so I mean, I watch F1, though.

2022
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,500
 That's my.

2023
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,000
 That's my sport of choice.

2024
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:09,400
 Yeah.

2025
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,100
 All right.

2026
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,100
 I'm trying to get a feel for how much my next one will cost.

2027
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:14,600
 Okay.

2028
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,600
 Oh gosh.

2029
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,600
 It's probably going to cost more because I'm getting whatever has more.

2030
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,600
 I'm sure you're 92.

2031
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:27,000
 It'll probably be two in the two fifties because you know the max has a hundred and higher many or.

2032
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
 What is the max?

2033
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,200
 Let's see what the current Macbook Pro M1 Max M3 Max, whatever the hell it is.

2034
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,600
 I keep saying M1.

2035
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,800
 All right, let's go to buy.

2036
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,500
 It's got to be 128.

2037
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,000
 Yeah.

2038
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
 I think so.

2039
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
 I don't think it is.

2040
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,800
 Yeah, that's what I think.

2041
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,600
 But I don't know.

2042
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,000
 Wait, I'll never click that button.

2043
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,200
 Man, that's one.

2044
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,300
 Well, it's yeah, it's 128.

2045
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:52,600
 Yeah.

2046
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,500
 So I would expect to have 256.

2047
01:21:54,500 --> 01:22:00,800
 So yeah, I'm probably going to be dropping eight thousand dollars.

2048
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,700
 That is insane.

2049
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,000
 Yeah, which is what I'm like.

2050
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,200
 I'm going to blow through my budget.

2051
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,800
 I only have a $10,000 a year budget.

2052
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,400
 And.

2053
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:08,900
 Yeah.

2054
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,100
 Oh, so oh, yeah, you did return these, right?

2055
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,000
 Wait.

2056
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,200
 Oh, yeah.

2057
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:13,500
 Yeah.

2058
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:18,400
 So yeah, I bought the M3 Max and man, I said you not opened it.

2059
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,100
 And it's set on my desk.

2060
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,000
 I was just like, fuck this.

2061
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
 I'm not about to do this.

2062
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,500
 Yes.

2063
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,100
 Yeah, it didn't.

2064
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:24,800
 I didn't do that.

2065
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,200
 I put it in like it was just on the thing.

2066
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,700
 I didn't open like it was like I didn't even pull off the paper.

2067
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,500
 You know the thing.

2068
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,000
 I got it.

2069
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,400
 And I was like, man, I'm going to set it up.

2070
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,300
 And then I thought about it.

2071
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:38,300
 I'm like, this is going to take me days.

2072
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,300
 Or weeks.

2073
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,300
 And it takes me weeks to set up these things.

2074
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,300
 I'm like, I don't want to deal with it.

2075
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,600
 So I sent it back.

2076
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,600
 I'm just like, I'll wait.

2077
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,840
 That's why I'm on the fence about whether or not I'm going to get an M3

2078
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:53,400
 ultra is because this is my main machine, which means I will be forced to deal

2079
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,700
 with it and I hate deal with it.

2080
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,600
 You'll get the notice about me.

2081
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,400
 So, but like I hate deal with anything and.

2082
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:04,100
 Man, it's it's given me anxiety now to know that I would have to like set up

2083
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:04,500
 this.

2084
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,200
 There's a lot of stuff that you all don't see.

2085
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,900
 And I think that's why it may not make a lot of sense to you all, but I have a lot

2086
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,600
 of things going on.

2087
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,200
 This is a very highly customized machine and.

2088
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,500
 Yeah, I haven't automated yet.

2089
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:21,700
 I should remember we were shutting up the laptop.

2090
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:24,700
 Do you use them?

2091
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:32,000
 Are you not use them, but I can use them and I choose not to use them.

2092
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
 And it's not for any like it's not for like any.

2093
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:40,200
 Like reason in particular other than.

2094
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,500
 I was just asking what you said that you had to do all your setup stuff.

2095
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,900
 I was like, I know that's like big, big time.

2096
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:50,900
 Well, so I don't I don't use them, but.

2097
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,800
 I do I do have a I do have a them set up.

2098
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,900
 I just don't use it.

2099
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,900
 Yeah, I'll show you like some of the other things that are going on.

2100
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:03,300
 And some of this isn't really that custom except the aliases.

2101
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:03,600
 I guess.

2102
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,700
 So like if I go here, that this wouldn't work.

2103
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:08,200
 So let's say no, we'll go to quit.

2104
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:12,000
 All right, so let's go into actual repo.

2105
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,400
 We'll go to code here.

2106
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:18,300
 We'll use what's his like, but that's an example.

2107
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,900
 So like like this right here.

2108
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,800
 So I'm able to just go see shit.

2109
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:27,600
 No, or if I don't have any Docker containers running right now, but if I did,

2110
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,700
 you see all my Docker containers or the fact that I want to do this and I want to see things.

2111
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,700
 Like all of this is no.

2112
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:40,600
 These these aren't commands that you just see or I have certain git commands,

2113
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,100
 even though I don't I try not to use the CLI.

2114
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,900
 I try to use GitHub desktop, but I actually have custom git commands.

2115
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,200
 I don't have to type a bunch of shit.

2116
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,800
 I have network stuff that I had to get set up.

2117
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:58,100
 I'm on like I run a run to networks here and like I have my NAS and all that stuff.

2118
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,200
 But also have other machines that I will need to configure.

2119
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:07,000
 And right now I have a account on all of my different machines where I can log in from here.

2120
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,200
 I would have to go to all my other machines and set up that account.

2121
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:15,800
 So that means I have to drive way to fuck the parallel and to go make sure that that one set up.

2122
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,200
 I have to go and get my laptop to make sure that set up.

2123
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,300
 I have a laptop over here.

2124
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:23,200
 I have to get set up and then I have to get them the M1 set up the max.

2125
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:27,300
 So it's like it's it's a lot of things and that's just that part.

2126
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:31,900
 There's not that's not including all the custom software that I have the software that I built myself.

2127
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,200
 I have to like I had to rebuild and like do.

2128
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,400
 There's my visual studio set up.

2129
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,500
 There's Android because I do Android stuff.

2130
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,700
 I do like iOS stuff.

2131
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,300
 There's it's just a lot of stuff.

2132
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,600
 So where?

2133
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,300
 Yeah.

2134
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,100
 And then there's my music stuff.

2135
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:55,000
 So I don't really do this online, but like I still I'm still in music.

2136
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,300
 And I have a lot of audio stuff.

2137
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,900
 So I have logic, which is easy.

2138
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:04,000
 You know, that's easy to do, but you know, able to live all of my all of my plugins.

2139
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:10,200
 I have dozens of plugins that I would have to install all of the licensing that I would have to do.

2140
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,600
 I have to go and get, you know, do all the licensing.

2141
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,600
 You see you see where I'm come from.

2142
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,700
 It takes me weeks.

2143
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,700
 Yeah.

2144
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,700
 And I'm just seeing what I do with the new computers.

2145
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:21,600
 I had eggs for you.

2146
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,500
 I need one.

2147
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,300
 No, I need a new new man with Pro for sure.

2148
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:31,100
 I think this one is the Intel one or yeah, I still I got the last of the Intel.

2149
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,800
 So the thing is just like.

2150
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:40,200
 So do you need a laptop or do you want a laptop or would you be working on a desktop?

2151
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:44,500
 I mean, I use my laptop as a desktop.

2152
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,100
 Okay, I see.

2153
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,000
 So I got a question right quick.

2154
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,400
 Let's see.

2155
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,900
 How much RAM are you using on average when you go on full throttle?

2156
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,300
 I'm hitting swap.

2157
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
 That's how much I'm using.

2158
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
 I'm hitting swap.

2159
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,600
 I have 64 gigabytes on this right now.

2160
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,900
 I'm not really doing much.

2161
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:06,000
 So I'm only using whatever this is.

2162
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:16,800
 Yeah, I'm not using much right now, but when I'm actually going doing like for real stuff, I'm using swap and generally I have my streaming stuff running and it's not necessarily streaming.

2163
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,200
 I also use it as a recorder.

2164
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,600
 I will like I sometimes have final cut open.

2165
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,500
 I may have my like Android studio open.

2166
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,500
 I generally have databases running in the background.

2167
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:32,500
 There's Docker generally running in the background along with all of these different projects that I may have up.

2168
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:36,700
 Then there's the applications that I generally have open all the time.

2169
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:45,100
 I have slack open all the time, discord open all the time, obsidian open most of the time, desktop open all the time.

2170
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:49,300
 I mean, I have superhuman and all this stuff.

2171
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,800
 I have certain things that are just always running and the granite.

2172
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:58,800
 You don't need 200, whatever gigabytes for that, but the large language model said I load into memory.

2173
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,700
 I need it for that.

2174
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:14,300
 So there are certain models that I straight up can't use or I mean, I can if I'm willing to accept a lower quantization number, but no, I would like to be able to load the biggest model possible so I can get the best results.

2175
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,800
 So yeah, hopefully that gives you an answer.

2176
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:23,600
 I know that is common that a lot of people like no one needs that much RAM, but some people actually do stuff on their computers.

2177
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,700
 And I mean, I do that and sometimes I have windows open.

2178
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:33,400
 So I generally have windows open because I do like financial modeling from time to time.

2179
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:40,700
 So I use windows for that or I may need to test certain things parallel or yeah, yeah, parallel.

2180
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:41,200
 Yeah.

2181
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:41,500
 Yeah.

2182
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:49,100
 Which means that it's going through the Rosetta to translation and all that is fast, but it uses RAM.

2183
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:54,500
 And I do know I said I don't play games, but there are two games that I actually do play.

2184
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:59,900
 It's the Oregon Trail and city skylines.

2185
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,700
 It's just I can't run city.

2186
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,700
 I can't run city skylines on this.

2187
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,100
 Yeah.

2188
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,500
 On the M3.

2189
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:06,900
 I can't.

2190
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,300
 I'm not going to run it on the M3.

2191
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:12,700
 So those are like, I mean, not city skylines, but it's.

2192
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:19,700
 It's pretty much stem city, the new version of some city, but those are like the two first, you know, computer games.

2193
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:20,700
 I ever played.

2194
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,200
 Yeah.

2195
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,200
 We see it in Trobe and number one.

2196
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,300
 And then have you.

2197
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,800
 Have you seen the new organ trophy on Apple?

2198
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,000
 I'll Apple Arcade.

2199
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,300
 No, I have it.

2200
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:30,900
 So dope.

2201
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,600
 I would open it.

2202
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,400
 But last time I did it, I got copyright.

2203
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,800
 So wow.

2204
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,300
 You two, bro.

2205
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,500
 I'll open it up over here.

2206
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:37,800
 Yeah.

2207
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,300
 Yeah.

2208
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,500
 It's in Apple Arcade.

2209
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,000
 It's pretty dope.

2210
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,400
 So yeah, now we know that I'm about to man, my gosh.

2211
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:47,300
 And that's a lot of money to spend to have to do extra work.

2212
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,700
 That's the day like I'm a drop.

2213
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:51,700
 I'm like that black.

2214
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:52,700
 Oh my god.

2215
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,100
 Well, I wouldn't get to the color look.

2216
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:59,100
 Yeah, I think well, you had a video on your Instagram, I think.

2217
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,400
 I did.

2218
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,600
 Oh, yeah.

2219
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,100
 Yeah.

2220
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,100
 It doesn't actually look like that.

2221
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,800
 It's not actually it doesn't look like that like that in person.

2222
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:10,100
 It looks just like a darker gray and certain in certain angles.

2223
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,400
 Also, it's like space gradient.

2224
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,900
 Yeah, it looks like space.

2225
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,600
 Way better than this.

2226
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,500
 Yeah, I wouldn't call it way better.

2227
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,900
 But this is not mean.

2228
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:18,800
 It's okay.

2229
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,500
 I thought it was black because that would be cold.

2230
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,300
 Yeah, it would be.

2231
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,100
 It would be dope.

2232
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,500
 They used to have the old the old one used to be black.

2233
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:25,900
 I know.

2234
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,700
 But you still do know one?

2235
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:29,800
 Yeah, way back.

2236
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,200
 Yeah, they used to be made out of plastic to the polycarbonate ones.

2237
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,000
 I don't.

2238
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,200
 Yeah.

2239
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:35,400
 Yeah.

2240
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,100
 The old polycarbonate Macbook, bros.

2241
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,800
 They came in black.

2242
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,400
 Black black.

2243
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:45,100
 And then my name went to these unibody design.

2244
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:52,400
 They they were in silver and you know, they I think they really spaced space gray later.

2245
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,400
 As a second option or whatever.

2246
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,200
 It's been a while.

2247
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:00,100
 But yeah, I think the Mac studio may be that but I don't really care about colors.

2248
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,300
 Like I'm sorry.

2249
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:02,000
 Yeah, I was.

2250
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,900
 I'm just saying for it to be kind of a new always just get the silver like the aluminum.

2251
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:07,500
 Whatever.

2252
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,200
 Whatever that is all for.

2253
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:13,600
 But maybe I'll switch it up and get it.

2254
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,900
 I think it just looks clean.

2255
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,000
 Everything it does until you touch it.

2256
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,200
 Yeah, sure.

2257
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:24,400
 So your fingerprints all over the place and it's not so clean anymore.

2258
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:29,700
 That's one of the benefits of getting the silver one is a fingerprint show up less.

2259
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:33,000
 So if you care about that kind of stuff, I kind of stuff irks me.

2260
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,900
 I hate seeing fingerprints and all that kind of stuff on anything.

2261
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,400
 All right.

2262
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,400
 I got another question.

2263
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,200
 Do you have a PC set up as well with a four year 90?

2264
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:41,700
 No, I don't.

2265
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:48,600
 This is a this is exclusively exclusively Apple Mac household.

2266
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,800
 I own nothing that is from inferior brands.

2267
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,100
 Am I like anything where I have to do work and that's what I mean.

2268
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:04,600
 Like, you know, you may optimize performance and I understand that, but I optimize my experience using the stuff.

2269
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,900
 I don't enjoy windows at all.

2270
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:09,500
 I mean, I have it, but I only work for me.

2271
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,200
 They're like, I got a little bit of it though.

2272
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,100
 I mean, I'm not for that.

2273
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:13,800
 I use that word.

2274
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,500
 It's pretty much all.

2275
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:18,700
 You know what I did when I when I was forced to use windows.

2276
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,900
 I quit the job.

2277
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:25,800
 I said, I mean, well, it's kind of an industry standard, man.

2278
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,400
 It's like not where I am, bro.

2279
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,400
 Like I'm like, you're not wrong.

2280
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,000
 Very many.

2281
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,500
 You're not wrong.

2282
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,800
 You're not wrong.

2283
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,800
 You're right.

2284
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,500
 Most of most people use windows.

2285
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:41,300
 However, there are certain organizations, even with an engineering, they use Macs.

2286
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:45,900
 Well, I'm talking about my like cat design is almost.

2287
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,400
 Yeah, almost exclusive.

2288
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:47,800
 Really?

2289
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,500
 Yeah, I don't really know.

2290
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:54,100
 Are you saying I don't just now that's a katia?

2291
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,000
 You know what that is?

2292
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,100
 No, I've never heard of it.

2293
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,300
 Okay.

2294
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,200
 No, I never heard of it.

2295
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,000
 Yeah.

2296
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,400
 Like inferior from the standpoint of.

2297
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:07,100
 Was was Apple all I do is buy in a like it.

2298
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,200
 It's not even think of it as an appliance, right?

2299
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:15,100
 Like you when you go to a store, you buy a refrigerator or a microwave and you plug it in and the shit works.

2300
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:18,200
 That to me, that's the experience that I want.

2301
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,800
 Like I want to go to a store.

2302
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,800
 I don't want to be presented with like infinite combinations or permutations of options.

2303
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,200
 I don't like I don't care enough.

2304
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,400
 I want to have four options.

2305
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,900
 I know some people are lack of choice.

2306
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,200
 I love lack of choice.

2307
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,900
 That's where creativity comes in.

2308
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:41,900
 Like when I was making music, the best music that I made was when I had like the most constraints.

2309
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:50,400
 And I'm not saying that you want to be constrained with computing, but I think Apple does a fair job of like giving you enough options to where you'll be.

2310
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:50,900
 Okay.

2311
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:53,200
 Generally the the highest option is what I get.

2312
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:58,600
 And I have to upgrade every two years or every year sometimes back in the end.

2313
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:09,400
 So days back in the back in the end, so this is actually the first time in a very long time that I've gone multiple years without having to upgrade my machine, which if I can eat out three years.

2314
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:14,700
 Oh my gosh, that would be that would be a achievement because there are sometimes where it's like.

2315
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:19,700
 Yeah, I would end up having to get another machine because what I was doing just wasn't caped.

2316
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,900
 I couldn't do it on the machine that I had.

2317
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:25,700
 But since we've left Intel, we've been good.

2318
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:26,900
 They're real good.

2319
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:27,600
 All right.

2320
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,400
 Where did I leave off?

2321
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,500
 I think I showed we have the we have the audio right here.

2322
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,500
 So yeah, we have the audio.

2323
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,800
 Now we need to do something else.

2324
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,600
 We need to we need to resample the audio.

2325
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,700
 Apparently you could use ff impact to do that.

2326
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:40,800
 I don't know how to do it.

2327
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,800
 So I'm going to do it using the tool that I know how to do it with.

2328
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,100
 And when I say know how to do it with that's an air quotes.

2329
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,000
 Really I'm going to fuck them doing ever.

2330
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,300
 All right.

2331
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:57,100
 So we're going to use socks and then we're going to pass in our audio file, which is that thing right there.

2332
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,900
 And then we're going to say the new option to resample.

2333
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:04,000
 And I think I need to tell it what sample rate I want.

2334
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,900
 Are you all familiar with sample rates?

2335
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,600
 Like what do they mean?

2336
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,800
 I don't know.

2337
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,300
 Okay.

2338
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:11,100
 All right.

2339
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:13,500
 Let's open up obsidian right quick.

2340
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:22,100
 For some reason, always opens up an extra right blindingly brown and blindingly bright mode.

2341
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,000
 Okay.

2342
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:23,500
 Here we are.

2343
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:26,900
 Oh man.

2344
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:27,800
 Yeah, this is going to be fun.

2345
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,000
 Can we even draw?

2346
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,200
 Think what I'm what I want to draw here.

2347
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,100
 Yeah.

2348
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:34,600
 What are you?

2349
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,400
 I want to draw a sign wave.

2350
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:40,500
 How do I draw a sign wave?

2351
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:41,600
 Can it's that possible?

2352
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,100
 Do I just like do this?

2353
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,600
 We'll do that.

2354
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,000
 Can I add a point?

2355
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,100
 Okay.

2356
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:47,300
 Yeah.

2357
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,000
 Oh, look at that.

2358
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,200
 Okay.

2359
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,700
 So I can add a point and then can I add another point?

2360
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:55,000
 Wait, I can only add one point.

2361
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,100
 Shit.

2362
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,100
 Okay.

2363
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:00,700
 Well, I have a I have a way that I can I think I can fix this up.

2364
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:03,700
 We'll make this smaller and then I'll duplicate it.

2365
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:07,800
 And can I flip it?

2366
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,300
 Does it allow me to rotate?

2367
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,000
 Oh, look at that.

2368
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:13,900
 Look at that.

2369
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:16,300
 Look at that sexy sign wave right there.

2370
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:18,400
 All right.

2371
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:18,900
 All right.

2372
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,600
 So we have a halfway sign wave.

2373
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,300
 I'm not going to we're just going to pretend that it goes all the way.

2374
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:23,800
 Right.

2375
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
 And then we'll do a little do like one of these things right here.

2376
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:36,300
 And then we'll do another one of those things actually will do an arrow because this is going to go in.

2377
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:40,200
 No, into infinity right there.

2378
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:40,400
 All right.

2379
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:40,800
 Cool.

2380
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,700
 So this is generally like this is analog signal.

2381
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:50,400
 So we'll say that we'll say this analog analog signal or we'll say sign wave.

2382
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,600
 Right.

2383
01:36:52,600 --> 01:37:01,700
 So in nature, everything like there is no, there is no discrete steps to go from one to another thing.

2384
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:01,900
 Right.

2385
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:05,300
 Like you have to go through all of the values, all infinite values to get to the next value.

2386
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:08,600
 Now in computing, we can't do this.

2387
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:09,900
 That's just way too much of a rate.

2388
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,800
 We can't do it ever.

2389
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:16,700
 So what we do is we have this concept of a sample rate, which is let me put this here and so it's a sample rate.

2390
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:21,400
 So let's say that I wanted to know what this value is here.

2391
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,000
 So we take a sample.

2392
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,800
 So this is our sample here and let's say that this value we're going to make up a number.

2393
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:32,800
 I don't really know what it would be, but we'll say that this sample right here is 5.7.

2394
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,200
 I don't know what whatever that is.

2395
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,700
 I'll just type 5.3.

2396
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:36,400
 Right.

2397
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:45,000
 Well, if I want to reconstruct this wave, if I just took this one sample, all out like I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to reconstruct the wave.

2398
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,400
 There's not enough information.

2399
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,600
 Right.

2400
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:52,300
 Like if you think about if you want to plot something on a graph, you put a lot of dots and then you can connect the dots.

2401
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,300
 See the full.

2402
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:53,800
 Yes.

2403
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,600
 And the more dots you have, the more fidelity you have, the less dots you have, the less fidelity you have.

2404
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:05,200
 Or if you go into a calculus mode, I guess it would be the equivalent to the little wiggle in your derivative, whatever.

2405
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:05,800
 What is it?

2406
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,300
 The X.

2407
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:16,400
 Yeah, I think whatever DX is like you could wiggle that a little bit and if you make it smaller or if you make it into tiny enough slices, you can reconstruct something where it looks like the original, the original input.

2408
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:20,100
 It's the same thing here, where it's like we are taking samples.

2409
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:30,500
 A sample is literally we measure a value at a certain time and we measure it over in frequencies or I'm sorry, yeah, in frequency because it's, you know, it's a cycle.

2410
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,000
 We do it so many times a second.

2411
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:41,700
 Generally for most computer audio or I'm sorry, most CD audio, you're hearing 44,100 samples per second.

2412
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:50,200
 So that means that when it was being recorded, you know, the microphone, what you're hearing me right now, my computer is currently taking a sample of what.

2413
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:54,900
 What I'm saying, 48,000 times a second, I'm at 48 kilohertz right now.

2414
01:38:54,900 --> 01:39:00,600
 So 48,000 times a second and that's being sent across the wire to y'all.

2415
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:17,000
 Obviously there's there's a stuff that happens before that, but for all the sense of purposes, I'm sending that that all these samples to you all and it's being reconstructed by your your DAC into audio ways and what that is is just like your the what you call these things.

2416
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,600
 The speaker, you know, the little magnet in your ear.

2417
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:36,500
 Well, the amount of voltage that you put into that into the into the speaker is going to dictate how like how much force it goes like this with like it's being controlled by these values right here.

2418
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,500
 So if you do it, know enough times you'll know reproduce.

2419
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:44,900
 Anyway, so let's take another sample here and we'll do this right here and let's say that this sample.

2420
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:47,200
 I don't know what it would be. I just know it's probably lower.

2421
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:52,600
 So let's just say this is 2.1 something and then we will take a lot of samples.

2422
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,400
 All right.

2423
01:39:53,400 --> 01:40:04,200
 So what I need to do is I need to take audio that has 48,000 of these and turn it into audio that has 16,000 of these per second.

2424
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,600
 So that's what I'm doing here.

2425
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,000
 That's what the 16 K is.

2426
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,200
 It's taking it from the original, which I think I had up the other day.

2427
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:12,500
 Yeah.

2428
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:20,300
 So here you see where it says sample rate 48 kilohertz 48,000 samples a second.

2429
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,100
 I wanted a 16.

2430
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:23,900
 So I'm reducing it by a factor of four.

2431
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:33,200
 This is going to have the effect of reducing the file size because you know you have less data that you have to represent like less sample.

2432
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:36,100
 So we're going to see a small reduction or about a.

2433
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:45,900
 It's not going to be quite a four time reduction, but it'll be close like it'll be between three to four times smaller than what it is now.

2434
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:51,000
 Now you may think that it's going to like change the audio and it will.

2435
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,300
 But this is where you get into something called the Nyquist theorem.

2436
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,900
 Maybe you knew about this one.

2437
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:57,900
 He's here.

2438
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:03,700
 But the sample rate dictates the max frequency that you can hear.

2439
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,100
 So it's about twice the frequency.

2440
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:20,200
 So the max frequency that I would be able to hear would be about eight, eight kilohertz, which when you think about voice, that's okay because our voice is in between a hundred hertz and about maybe 10,000 kilohertz.

2441
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,000
 If you're singing, no hot pitch notes.

2442
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
 All right.

2443
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,100
 So we'll do that.

2444
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,000
 We'll resample it.

2445
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,800
 And then we're going to just name it.

2446
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,100
 I guess we'll say 20, 24.

2447
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:30,100
 Oops.

2448
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:36,400
 Oh, two, oh, three, 16 k wave.

2449
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,800
 And hopefully this works.

2450
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:38,700
 It probably will.

2451
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,700
 Oh, yeah, look at that.

2452
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:41,600
 I know what I'm doing.

2453
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,900
 Look at me.

2454
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:45,400
 So it's right in the file.

2455
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,900
 So it's going to take a little bit and we can.

2456
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:52,100
 Break clip 16 samples.

2457
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:54,200
 I don't know if I care.

2458
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,700
 Are you telling me this?

2459
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:57,400
 We make sure that this is okay.

2460
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,300
 Yeah, here we are.

2461
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:05,600
 So we see that it's 480 megabytes and let's compare it to the original, which was 1.44 gigabytes.

2462
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:10,900
 Do we agree that that's about a factor of four ish maybe a little bit?

2463
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:19,200
 Well, do the math and it's about four is three to four.

2464
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:20,000
 All right.

2465
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,700
 So now we have this audio and we can play it if we want.

2466
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:23,500
 I don't want to play it.

2467
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,600
 We know it's audio.

2468
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,400
 So the next thing is using, where's my notes?

2469
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,500
 Do y'all understand the sampling all this?

2470
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:31,900
 We're good.

2471
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:37,100
 I noticed I have a half baked explanation, but I wasn't intending to do this.

2472
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:42,300
 So is that are y'all satisfied with what you know so far about sample rates?

2473
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:48,000
 Yes, almost a pro almost what coding language is this?

2474
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,700
 Shell bash.

2475
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:54,200
 So this is the shell.

2476
01:42:54,900 --> 01:43:01,000
 And so far you haven't I don't know when you came, but so far you haven't seen any code.

2477
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,100
 Now, if you came earlier, this right here is TypeScript.

2478
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:10,600
 And if you were here at some other point, this right here is sequel.

2479
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:16,300
 And it just depends on when you come like I don't know what language you came in at.

2480
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,400
 But all this is shell.

2481
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,000
 That's crazy man.

2482
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,900
 You talented.

2483
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,900
 You got all of those.

2484
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,600
 Well, I don't like to say talented.

2485
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,800
 I would prefer to say skilled because it's something that I have to work at.

2486
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:34,500
 Like talented people tend to just have some type of natural ability.

2487
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:48,600
 And honestly, I think that, you know, especially in this field, I think that is the people who have talent who could end up being surpassed by the people who had to work to develop the skill.

2488
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,800
 It's kind of like that's that's pretty much everything man.

2489
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:56,400
 Well, yeah, I mean, I think that's it.

2490
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,500
 I think that's it's a natural talent.

2491
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:59,300
 Get lazy.

2492
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:00,100
 Yes.

2493
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:07,000
 Yes, that's basically it's from getting that where it's just like if you can just if it just like you just do it naturally, then you'll become a little lazy.

2494
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:07,900
 All right.

2495
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:12,000
 So now we have this this new sample here.

2496
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,200
 So we'll look at it here and this the 16 K now I have a program.

2497
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:26,200
 So we'll open up another thing, a jig and we'll go into my code directory code and color here.

2498
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,000
 All right.

2499
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,500
 So now we have this is whisper and I've already built it.

2500
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,400
 So all I need to do is main.

2501
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,200
 Oops.

2502
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,800
 That's main.

2503
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:37,300
 Then I can tell it what I want.

2504
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:41,200
 So in this case, I want we'll do text.

2505
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,100
 We'll do text for now.

2506
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:46,100
 I'm going to do that.

2507
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,100
 It's our team.

2508
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:50,100
 I'm going to do both eventually and then I'm going to give it the file.

2509
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,300
 Remember the file is in my process directory.

2510
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:59,100
 So we'll name that path, which is whatever this is process audio and I need to give it to 16 kilobyte kilohertz version of that.

2511
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:02,700
 And then yeah, we'll just do that.

2512
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:06,900
 So now we are transcribing my audio from that video.

2513
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:11,100
 So this is what I need to automate in the thing, right?

2514
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:14,600
 Like this is what, you know, the bot is eventually going to do.

2515
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,700
 What library are you using for that?

2516
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:18,700
 This is whisper.

2517
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:19,400
 This is whisper.

2518
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,000
 See people like this is whisper.

2519
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,100
 Okay.

2520
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:25,000
 Yeah, it's really cool.

2521
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,400
 Now.

2522
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,300
 That's all being done locally.

2523
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:28,900
 Yes.

2524
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:38,400
 Hence the reason why it's like, you know, like it's not doing much now, but let's let's pretend that I have more than one video on my machine.

2525
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,200
 Let's just pretend.

2526
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:47,100
 Let's pretend that maybe I don't want to have to do one after the other and I would like to use all 20 of my chords because I have 20 of these bitches.

2527
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:56,100
 It makes a lot of sense to me that if I were to run all of these transcriptions, let's say I'm doing 10, 15, 20 at a time, my ram usage is going to shoot up.

2528
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,700
 And let's also pretend that I'm probably going to be doing more than just this.

2529
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:00,500
 Right.

2530
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:03,200
 Like this is just the first part of it to transcription.

2531
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:11,100
 Once I get to transcription, I'm going to load all of this into my LOM and have it produce my description, my video description.

2532
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,600
 So I don't have to know.

2533
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,300
 I don't actually know what I'll talk about most of the time.

2534
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,300
 I'm going to kind of make all this up.

2535
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,600
 So this is a good way for me to know what the hell I even did it.

2536
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:32,000
 So I want to be able to know feed this into a LOM, create embeddings, take the vectors because it's going to give me back a vector store that in my database and then I can use something like cosine similarity to figure out.

2537
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:42,600
 You know, if I give it a search term, I would embed that do a cosine similarity and be like, all right, well, this thing right here is most closely related to these, these particular things.

2538
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:52,800
 And if I have the time stamps and the video, which I do, I can essentially get it to a point where I can click a link and say, all right, I clicked this according to my thing is this time stamp.

2539
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,400
 I can encode that and I'll show you how I can encode that.

2540
01:46:55,400 --> 01:47:00,300
 And you know, this is just just look at YouTube and you can see how you do it actually.

2541
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,300
 So let's go to YouTube right quick.

2542
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:14,600
 We'll take this, whatever he's talking about and then we'll just select this and then let's go to share right here and start at you'll see that it's going to add a query parameter here.

2543
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,600
 Let's go back.

2544
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,900
 See here that T equal 105.

2545
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:20,600
 I can use this.

2546
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,400
 This is what engineering comes in, right?

2547
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:27,800
 Where it's like, all right, I'm able to tell you to where in the video I wanted to drop me.

2548
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:32,600
 So let's imagine that I'm like, hey, get ups or whatever.

2549
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,700
 I don't, it's right now it's called Wachie Slackbot.

2550
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:36,300
 Hey, Wachie Slackbot.

2551
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:40,400
 Hey, I want to know when did I talk about sample rates?

2552
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,300
 Oh, well, let me go and find that it's fine.

2553
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:52,300
 It's all the videos that I talked about and where I talked about that and gives me back a result and I can just click on it and it takes me to the place where I was saying that that's what that's, that's what I'm trying to do.

2554
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:52,500
 Nice.

2555
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,800
 What it's going to be dope.

2556
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,000
 Yeah.

2557
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:58,700
 I had to get there, like that.

2558
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:00,200
 And here's the thing.

2559
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,100
 Here's what makes it hard.

2560
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:03,900
 It's not the actual space is on this.

2561
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,100
 Taking up my phone, my phone space.

2562
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:10,800
 Yeah, in terms of just like hard drive space, like.

2563
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,300
 I don't know.

2564
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:12,700
 Let's see.

2565
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,300
 It's like 16.

2566
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,400
 You said it's probably more than that.

2567
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,600
 Let's, uh, let's see.

2568
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,700
 We talk to TV's or.

2569
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:27,400
 I will see.

2570
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,600
 Uh, thank you.

2571
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,900
 I was going to be.

2572
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:39,100
 I mean, like everything though with the, with the videos and all like once you have like, uh, you know, your library that you're going to be searching through.

2573
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:41,500
 Oh, yeah, that's what I'm of your past footage.

2574
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:41,900
 Okay.

2575
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:42,900
 Yeah, that's what I'm about to show.

2576
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,900
 I was just, I was just, for whatever reason it was taken forever to connect.

2577
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,900
 I got you.

2578
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:52,100
 And then it don't even know that I don't want to use that account will use this account.

2579
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:57,100
 Seriously though, what's up with one password right now?

2580
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:59,500
 It's your ass.

2581
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,900
 All right, let's do.

2582
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,100
 Uh, this is a mess.

2583
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:06,400
 Copy that password.

2584
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:13,400
 I wonder if.

2585
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:15,200
 Huh.

2586
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,900
 What?

2587
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,900
 All right.

2588
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:20,900
 Now I'm a little confused.

2589
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:21,200
 What?

2590
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:21,700
 Wait, what?

2591
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:22,700
 How come that didn't work?

2592
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:26,900
 All right, let's go here.

2593
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:28,200
 Copy.

2594
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:31,200
 I wonder if I misspelled my name.

2595
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,200
 No, I didn't.

2596
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,800
 It's just, I don't know what that was about.

2597
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:35,300
 Oops.

2598
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:41,000
 Uh, no, don't do anything.

2599
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,500
 I am currently using nine terabytes.

2600
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,400
 Okay.

2601
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:45,800
 Yeah.

2602
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,400
 I knew it had to be up in there.

2603
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:49,000
 It had to be in TV.

2604
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,200
 So that's, that's sizable.

2605
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:51,700
 I saw it.

2606
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,200
 Yeah.

2607
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:52,900
 And that's on the.

2608
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,200
 That's like, that's on the.

2609
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,600
 I used to max studio as a cash.

2610
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,400
 I think this has two terabytes.

2611
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,900
 So like there's stuff on here and then over time I move it over to the.

2612
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:02,300
 That's.

2613
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:05,000
 And then the same thing on my MacBook Pro.

2614
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,300
 That's also two terabytes.

2615
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,400
 Eventually I moved things from there and put it onto the.

2616
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:09,900
 Nast.

2617
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:12,300
 It's a lot slower in there because it's Wi-Fi.

2618
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,000
 I have a 10 G network.

2619
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,100
 So if I can, if I can avoid it, I will never do it on there because it's like, it's just, it's so slow.

2620
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:20,800
 It is stupidly slow.

2621
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,600
 I can't tolerate slowness.

2622
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:26,100
 Some that I'm allergic to it almost.

2623
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:26,900
 All right.

2624
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:27,600
 Here we are.

2625
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:31,200
 So we have a file here and it dumped it in my process audio.

2626
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,200
 I don't actually know if I like that, but whatever.

2627
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:36,900
 Let's go back to here and look at it.

2628
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:39,400
 And yeah, we have the SRT.

2629
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:42,700
 So I'll open it and we'll use them about that.

2630
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:43,900
 You were talking about them earlier.

2631
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:44,500
 We'll do that.

2632
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:48,300
 We'll say, whatever that is, SRT.

2633
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:50,000
 All right.

2634
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:56,100
 And as we scroll down, we see here that we get the timestamp along with what I said at that time.

2635
01:50:56,100 --> 01:51:10,700
 So so already you should be understanding that it's like so long as I have this timestamp and what I said, it makes a lot of sense that if I were to create embeddings for this, I can get back that information out and say, well, what, like, when would I say this?

2636
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:13,300
 All right, it's going to be a huge database, man.

2637
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,300
 It's going to be really cool.

2638
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:18,100
 Well, the thing.

2639
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:22,700
 So I haven't, I haven't actually gone and checked to see what the size of these embeddings would be.

2640
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:31,000
 And honestly, if I might find out that they're stupidly large and I have to rethink how I'm doing this, I've already had to do that once.

2641
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,100
 And I first started this.

2642
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:41,200
 I was under the impression that, you know, Google was a good company and no, they actually had good developers and they would give you like webhook events when something happens.

2643
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:42,200
 They don't do that.

2644
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:47,600
 I have to basically, I had to pull their servers and I was just like, I don't want to pull their servers.

2645
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:51,900
 So I figured out a workaround, which is I'm using eCam and shortcuts.

2646
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:54,400
 So here, let me show Apple shortcuts.

2647
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:57,500
 One day open.

2648
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:57,900
 Okay.

2649
01:51:57,900 --> 01:52:03,100
 So this active stream right here or stream, this will, if I actually ran this, it will go off and do some things.

2650
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:09,100
 I'm not going to do it right now, but we go here and you see here that I'm making a curl request to my server.

2651
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:16,300
 Eventually, it'll be to the real server, which is, I'm not going to say what that is because I don't want people touching it, but it'll go to this real server.

2652
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:17,900
 It's authenticated.

2653
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:19,600
 So it's not like you do it anyway.

2654
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:25,400
 And then that's going to be the thing that kicks off the whole process of let me go and find the latest stream.

2655
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,800
 Let me, you know, put it in the database.

2656
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,700
 Let me create the note on GitHub.

2657
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:30,500
 That's what happens.

2658
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:36,600
 I'm not sure if you've seen any of this stuff, but it'll go off and create a pull request on GitHub along with create a file.

2659
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:37,900
 I can show you that right quick.

2660
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,400
 I'm not going to show it doing it.

2661
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:42,400
 I'll just show you one that was open, open the other day.

2662
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,700
 So we're going to GitHub.

2663
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:52,000
 So this is like the, you can call it like my, my target repository in a sense.

2664
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,500
 And eventually there'll be a GitHub app as well that will hand that handles a lot of the authentication.

2665
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:01,400
 This is what Yawnee was talking about maybe doing earlier, which was doing that.

2666
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:05,400
 So here is a PR of one.

2667
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,300
 So this was learning the code.

2668
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,600
 A lot of this is the last time I did it.

2669
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:09,600
 I haven't ran it today.

2670
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,700
 So that's why you don't see it.

2671
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:13,700
 And you see there's one commit at dev log note.

2672
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:14,400
 I didn't do that.

2673
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,900
 By the way, just want to put that make that clear.

2674
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:16,600
 I didn't do that.

2675
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:17,800
 And this right here.

2676
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:23,500
 This comes from, if you look at my, my video description, this is literally my video description.

2677
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:26,600
 So the bot is doing this for me.

2678
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:30,300
 It's going off and creating this file, putting the video description here.

2679
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:37,200
 And when the stream ends, there's going to be another endpoint that I hit, which is then going to do the process that you're saying.

2680
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,900
 Now, which is it's going to go start the transcription process.

2681
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:41,800
 It's going to go create the embeddings.

2682
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,900
 It's going to store all that in the database.

2683
01:53:43,900 --> 01:54:00,200
 It's going to create my, my actual YouTube summary or description that I can then update on YouTube, generate all of my tags based off of what I said, updated on YouTube, create my amplification posts on social media, like Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn.

2684
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,700
 All of that will happen automatically.

2685
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:03,400
 So I don't have to do it.

2686
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:07,100
 So that's kind of what like I don't like doing.

2687
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:10,500
 TD is like this, anything that's like, I have to do it.

2688
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:11,200
 I don't want to do it.

2689
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:13,600
 And this is a theme.

2690
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:14,600
 It's crazy.

2691
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:15,100
 It's the theme.

2692
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:15,800
 That's what I mean.

2693
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:19,100
 It's like you got a whole, a whole team, right?

2694
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:22,700
 You know, like, how can I put this?

2695
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:23,600
 How can I put this?

2696
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:27,260
 Like, let's just say a huge streamer, biggest, Mr.

2697
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:29,500
 Beast, that's the first person to hang on mine.

2698
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:34,000
 He has, you know, employees that all do those things, you know, like,

2699
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:34,600
 Yes.

2700
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,200
 And you're just, yeah.

2701
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:36,800
 Yes.

2702
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:42,000
 I'm like, I have the ability to create a machine or like I can have my machines do that.

2703
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,300
 Yeah, that's really cool.

2704
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:44,300
 So yeah.

2705
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:45,300
 All right.

2706
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:48,800
 So now that we have this here, here's something else that we can do.

2707
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,800
 Let's let's see if we can do something new.

2708
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:51,700
 So I haven't done this.

2709
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:55,800
 I've been doing it manually, but maybe we'll end this stream because I have to.

2710
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,100
 I'm doing a nature walk soon.

2711
01:54:57,100 --> 01:55:00,000
 So like, well, in the stream soon.

2712
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,300
 So let's go to open AI.

2713
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:03,800
 I need to get in the gym and I'm supposed to go by now.

2714
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:08,700
 Yeah, it's saying like kind of like, though, I'm like, this is interesting.

2715
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,700
 So I could put that off a done.

2716
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:11,600
 I shot a night.

2717
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,400
 And kind of it.

2718
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,200
 It matters.

2719
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:14,600
 You should.

2720
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,400
 I mean, I'm still going.

2721
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,700
 I'm just saying it doesn't matter how late I start.

2722
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:21,500
 Like, I mean, I got to be up early tomorrow.

2723
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:26,300
 Okay, here we are.

2724
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:27,100
 Text generation.

2725
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:28,400
 Okay.

2726
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,300
 So here's what I'm planning to use for this.

2727
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,500
 I'm probably going to use chat.

2728
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,100
 I could use this.

2729
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:38,800
 It's this is where the engineering is going to come back into play.

2730
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,400
 It's like, all right, which one of these is the best thing for me to use.

2731
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:49,500
 And the reason why like it's harder for me to figure out here is because I don't plan to use open AI to do this.

2732
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:54,000
 I plan to do all this locally because I can do it locally while I like, why would I pay?

2733
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,700
 I pay them money to do it.

2734
01:55:55,700 --> 01:56:00,500
 Unless I'm going to start the development process using open API open AI,

2735
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:04,300
 but eventually it'll know I'll start to take over more and more responsibility,

2736
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:07,100
 especially once I figure out how much this costs.

2737
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:13,400
 If this is cheap, like it only cost me like a dollar to do one transcription and all of the things and I'll just use this.

2738
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:19,700
 Because, you know, I'm doing the math in my head where it's like, all right, it's going to take me this many hours to do it.

2739
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:21,300
 I know what my time is worth.

2740
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:23,700
 A dollar is nothing to me.

2741
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:27,200
 I'll happily know get in the middle dollar to go do this work.

2742
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:28,900
 So let's see.

2743
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:30,200
 We'll do the embedding.

2744
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:31,700
 So let's see how they get embedded in this.

2745
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:32,600
 All right.

2746
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:37,200
 So this is showing how to get the embeddings and yeah, let's see.

2747
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:39,000
 Do that.

2748
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,600
 Oh, wait, I need authorization shit.

2749
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,700
 Should I have to go create a key?

2750
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:45,200
 All right.

2751
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:50,400
 Maybe we won't do this because I would have to go create a key and I don't want you all seeing more keys.

2752
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:51,000
 Yeah.

2753
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
 Well, not y'all.

2754
01:56:52,000 --> 01:57:00,100
 If y'all want to see this, y'all being people on Zoom, we can do this another day like just on Zoom.

2755
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,300
 And I can share it.

2756
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:15,100
 I can actually walk through all of the stuff and then once we do it, I guess we can figure out or I will figure out how I can show this to other people without leaking keys and having to go and change things.

2757
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:21,100
 But yeah, like I would essentially be using the embeddings API initially to create my embeddings.

2758
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:24,100
 I wish that this shows you what an embedding looked like.

2759
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:29,100
 It's just it's think of it as like an array or it's a vector.

2760
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:31,100
 Just think of it as a vector of numbers.

2761
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:33,100
 If you want to think of it that way.

2762
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:37,100
 It would be cool if I can just like play with it here and not have.

2763
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:39,100
 Oh, wait, maybe I can't play around.

2764
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:40,100
 Look at that.

2765
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:41,100
 Look at that.

2766
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:43,100
 I don't want an assistant.

2767
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:44,100
 Oh, shit.

2768
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:45,100
 Okay.

2769
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:45,100
 Never mind.

2770
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:46,100
 I can't do it.

2771
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:50,100
 I was going to be like, maybe I can see what the embedding looks like here, but I won't be able to do that.

2772
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:55,100
 The only way I can do it is to actually do it, which would require me showing keys.

2773
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:57,100
 And I'm not going to do that.

2774
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:58,100
 Not right now.

2775
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:59,100
 Yeah.

2776
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:00,100
 All right.

2777
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:01,100
 Cool.

2778
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:06,100
 Man, I definitely got like now I understand what's going on.

2779
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:09,100
 Like what you're uh, what you're building.

2780
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:12,100
 That's that's really, really cool, man.

2781
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,100
 Yeah.

2782
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:16,100
 So, so far, I mean, this is way of ants.

2783
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:17,100
 I mean, never mind.

2784
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:19,100
 I'll try to double.

2785
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,100
 I wouldn't call it that advanced, but yeah.

2786
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:22,100
 No, no, no.

2787
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:25,100
 I was talking about like my question was going to be like way like.

2788
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:26,100
 Well, ask it.

2789
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:27,100
 Just ask it now.

2790
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,100
 So I can think about it if I don't know.

2791
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:32,100
 I mean, is it is it is it serviceable?

2792
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:34,100
 Can you offer this as a service?

2793
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:35,100
 Yes.

2794
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,100
 You know, eventually.

2795
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,100
 Yes.

2796
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:38,100
 Eventually.

2797
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:39,100
 Yes.

2798
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:43,100
 Now at the moment, because I'm doing all this stuff locally, it would be like.

2799
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:44,100
 All right.

2800
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:46,100
 So let's say I really want to offer this as a service.

2801
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:49,100
 I understand that now everybody uses a Mac.

2802
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:52,100
 Now everybody uses the same software that I use.

2803
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:57,100
 So I would have to do that all on the web server, which means that I would have to worry

2804
01:58:57,100 --> 01:59:00,100
 about compute costs.

2805
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,100
 I am on an incredibly fast machine.

2806
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:06,100
 I would need to have an incredibly fast machine and that costs money.

2807
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:08,100
 Uh, so it's like that part.

2808
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:13,100
 Now there's another option where I can, you know, maybe I can have it where it does it

2809
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:17,100
 locally on your machine, but then we write it to the problem of everybody doesn't have

2810
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:18,100
 a super powerful machine.

2811
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:19,100
 Yes.

2812
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:20,100
 Yes.

2813
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:24,100
 So if I really want to make this a nice service where it delivers to you, user experience that

2814
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:29,540
 I would want to deliver, it would have to be on the web, which there are a lot of things

2815
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:34,220
 to think about because, you know, videos can be very big, like very large.

2816
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:39,100
 How do I get the video from Yani's machine onto my server?

2817
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:44,100
 So this is also, yeah.

2818
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:47,100
 So this is like, man, damn man.

2819
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:50,100
 Yeah, I got like, I'll have questions or not even questions.

2820
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,100
 This is like a query.

2821
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:57,100
 Like, you know, it might, you know, uh, it takes me to like Silicon Valley, the show, right?

2822
01:59:57,100 --> 02:00:02,100
 Where they had to like do, uh, they had to figure out new compression, right?

2823
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:04,100
 Like they had to like to.

2824
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:05,100
 Yes.

2825
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:07,100
 I would actually be using some form of compression.

2826
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:10,820
 I don't know if Gzip would be the right one.

2827
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:15,780
 I know that there's a, it is broadly, I think that's the compression that should work well

2828
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:18,660
 for, um, for video, I think.

2829
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:19,660
 Here's broadly.

2830
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:24,620
 Um, like I would need to make sure that I mean, I would have to compress it.

2831
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:29,860
 Oh, by the way, if y'all want to like go into compression, that's actually one of my interests.

2832
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:35,220
 I've written compression algorithms in the past for reasons.

2833
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:40,700
 Uh, but yeah, like I would need to be able to compress this data, but it's already compressed,

2834
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:44,580
 most likely if it's impact or maybe I have to introduce constraints.

2835
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:51,500
 So it's like, Hey, you can only give me H.265 video and oh, it can only be a bit color space

2836
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:52,500
 or something like that.

2837
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:55,860
 Like I would have to have these constraints, but I don't want to have those constraints

2838
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:58,380
 because I don't want those constraints for myself.

2839
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:02,500
 So it's like these are things that I would have to think about, which is, you know, like

2840
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:07,380
 if I'm getting video from their computer to my server, that's bandwidth cost that I had

2841
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:08,380
 to pay for.

2842
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:11,580
 We just saw that one of my small videos is two gigabytes.

2843
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:14,100
 Some of my large videos are 20 gigabytes.

2844
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:16,980
 I would have to upload all of that to my server first.

2845
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:19,860
 So now I'm having to rely on your internet connection.

2846
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:22,780
 And also I know that internet connections are unreliable.

2847
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:23,860
 You're probably using Wi-Fi.

2848
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:26,500
 I have to deal with that because things could stop.

2849
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:30,340
 They could not work and like, I don't want to waste bandwidth because I pay for whether

2850
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:32,140
 it finishes or not.

2851
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:37,300
 So I would need to make sure that I have some way to resume an upload if something fails.

2852
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:40,620
 It's stuff like that where it's like, you don't really think about it until you start

2853
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:42,300
 having to realize that you're going to pay for it.

2854
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:44,020
 So you might want to think about it.

2855
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:47,700
 It's equivalent to like you're about to go to another city.

2856
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:53,580
 You have gas in your car, but then you try to go there and you can't get there.

2857
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:56,900
 So your only option is to get towed back to where you were.

2858
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:59,660
 You still pay the money to like you've lost all that money.

2859
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:00,980
 You lost all that time.

2860
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:02,980
 You have to redo it again.

2861
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:05,740
 So I have to think about that.

2862
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:08,500
 Right now, how I'm thinking about that is I'm just not.

2863
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:09,500
 I'm doing it all over the place.

2864
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:10,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2865
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:13,620
 It's better to build it locally, perfect it, man.

2866
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:16,740
 And then it was like, maybe I'll just turn it into a system.

2867
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:19,780
 That's why I said it was like, man, this is like way future stuff.

2868
02:02:19,780 --> 02:02:21,380
 Well, I've been thinking about these things.

2869
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:22,380
 It's super interesting.

2870
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:23,580
 I've been thinking about these things.

2871
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:30,820
 It's like obviously like this is like, this is almost like, I would say.

2872
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:38,860
 Streamers particularly are kind of like taking over like the gig economy, you know, like it.

2873
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:47,100
 I don't know to like some to some point, you know, where it's everybody's just trying

2874
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:52,760
 to do it now, you know, like in this is like laying it all out, making it easy for you

2875
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:57,260
 then is definitely value there.

2876
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,620
 And here's the value for me.

2877
02:02:58,620 --> 02:03:03,540
 And it's more than just doing this like, you're saying this right, a lot of people are trying

2878
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:06,100
 to get into content creation, but I think a lot of people.

2879
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:07,580
 That's what I'm looking for.

2880
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:10,060
 They struggle because they don't know what to talk about.

2881
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:11,900
 Like they all have to have an idea, whatever.

2882
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,340
 And my take is like, fuck all that.

2883
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:14,340
 I don't need to have an idea.

2884
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:15,980
 I'll just work on stuff live.

2885
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:17,340
 So just build this up.

2886
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:21,580
 So everything that and that's what I was getting at, like what makes this hard is that

2887
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:27,020
 the only time that I ever work on this is live when I'm streaming.

2888
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:28,980
 I have never done anything outside of streaming.

2889
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:32,540
 So that makes it hard because if I'm not streaming, I'm not doing this.

2890
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:36,940
 And you know, if you know, if you step away from a project, then you come back, you have

2891
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:39,820
 to like refigure out stuff, have to relearn stuff.

2892
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:41,700
 So that's what happens every time.

2893
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:44,940
 So when I'm coming back to this, I'm kind of like coming back fresh, or it's just like,

2894
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:46,380
 Oh man, I got to remember catch up.

2895
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:47,820
 What the hell did I do last time?

2896
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:50,420
 Hence the reason I used to take notes.

2897
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:54,220
 I think you remember this, Johnny, like I used to start my thing, my stream was like,

2898
02:03:54,220 --> 02:04:01,580
 here's what I want to do and that's what I don't know if you realize there were a checklist

2899
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:02,860
 that checklist is for that.

2900
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:07,940
 So like I would actually put my notes, no, an obsidian because it's a thing to GitHub.

2901
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:09,140
 And like, here's what I want to do.

2902
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:12,460
 And as I finish things, I can check it off and things that weren't checked off.

2903
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:14,180
 I can take those tasks.

2904
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:18,060
 And then on my next stream, I can pull those tasks and say, well, this is what you did last

2905
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,060
 time.

2906
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:20,700
 Here are the tasks that are incomplete.

2907
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:25,860
 So now I actually know what the hell to do versus spending 30 to 40 minutes rambling and

2908
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:28,300
 trying to figure out what I'm going to do for the day.

2909
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:34,140
 So I don't anymore use obsidian.

2910
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:35,820
 Oh, okay.

2911
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:37,700
 I was just familiar with the do who.

2912
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:39,700
 Oh, yeah, I know who it is.

2913
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:42,540
 Yeah, I love that guy.

2914
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:43,540
 Yeah.

2915
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:47,500
 And honestly, like the real world, I'm the same wavelength.

2916
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,700
 I need you know, I'm too, huh?

2917
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:50,540
 Yeah.

2918
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:52,460
 Amazing, amazing content.

2919
02:04:52,460 --> 02:04:53,460
 Yeah.

2920
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:54,460
 And it's up him building shit.

2921
02:04:54,460 --> 02:05:00,740
 So it's like, I was, I had it for like a year and a half, mostly just to support him.

2922
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:05,940
 But when I started working on this and I looked at, no, I was trying to figure out how can

2923
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:08,980
 I sync it to GitHub and I can't.

2924
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:11,700
 So I'm on obsidian now.

2925
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:16,580
 And it's purely for this project because I want to be able to have all of myself local.

2926
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:17,700
 That's where I'm going back towards.

2927
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:22,420
 Like, I know in the past 10, 15 years, everything is going to the web.

2928
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:23,420
 I hate that.

2929
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:24,940
 I've never enjoyed the web.

2930
02:05:24,940 --> 02:05:26,260
 I hate it to this day.

2931
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:27,980
 I like doing stuff on my computer.

2932
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:31,940
 Why would I go and blow all this money on my computer just to use someone else's so

2933
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:35,900
 that they can have all of my data so they can sell my information so they can make money

2934
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:36,900
 off of me.

2935
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:39,540
 I rather have that stuff for myself.

2936
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:40,540
 All right.

2937
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:46,700
 So that's kind of what's like what prompted me to like abandon ink drop and start using

2938
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:49,140
 obsidian because I can do stuff locally.

2939
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,140
 Same as GitHub.

2940
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:51,140
 GitHub is Git.

2941
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:53,500
 I can have all that stuff locally.

2942
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:56,340
 My servers, I can have all that stuff locally.

2943
02:05:56,340 --> 02:06:01,380
 Now if I don't know, if I want to monetize, yes, I would have to figure out a way to get

2944
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:02,500
 it into other people's hands.

2945
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:06,780
 But at that point, I would have a demo that I can show the people and then I can be like,

2946
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:11,620
 hey, like, if y'all want this, y'all are going to have to pay because make it like

2947
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:13,380
 other because I would have to develop it, right?

2948
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:15,780
 It's not like it's just going to exist.

2949
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:17,180
 Things require work.

2950
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:22,060
 And if people really, really, really want this, I would have to do this full time, which

2951
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:29,020
 means that I would have to make what kind of what I'm making now more, which that's

2952
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:30,020
 a lot.

2953
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:34,340
 So it's just like, there's a whole process to it, but for now it's just my excuse for

2954
02:06:34,340 --> 02:06:35,340
 content.

2955
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,180
 So I do this.

2956
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:42,620
 I mean, yeah, most great things start off as just like a little hobby anyway.

2957
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:47,060
 And then the other project that I'll leave you all with, because I'm switching back and

2958
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:48,060
 forth.

2959
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,460
 Like I have several projects that I work on.

2960
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:52,500
 I can't just do one thing.

2961
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:56,620
 I have the Division Pro project that I'm working on.

2962
02:06:56,620 --> 02:07:01,020
 I won't say the name now, but if you know what I know.

2963
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:08,540
 The idea is that for language learners, especially here, it's hard to learn your target language

2964
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:13,300
 if you don't see the words around you in your environment.

2965
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:21,860
 So my idea is that it would be really cool if I can attach words to objects in my environment.

2966
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:24,500
 And then if I can, if I go to that word, I can interact with it.

2967
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:29,580
 I can see like what, what part of speech is like what grammar it is, whether it's now

2968
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:31,860
 verb, you know, the verb, that kind of stuff.

2969
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:34,020
 Also words that I can use with it.

2970
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:37,700
 Also the location words so I can see relative to where it is.

2971
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:41,900
 And I was thinking about gamifying it so that, you know, if you're in a room, it gives you

2972
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:43,700
 the words that you should know.

2973
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:47,260
 And it kind of just like puts them in a bucket or something like that.

2974
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:49,540
 And it asks you to go and match it with the object.

2975
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:51,620
 So like I have a credenza right here.

2976
02:07:51,620 --> 02:07:53,740
 Like whatever that word is, I'm Mandarin.

2977
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:57,980
 Like I think I would have to look at the character, be like, all right, well, this is credenza

2978
02:07:57,980 --> 02:08:01,180
 and I would have to take it and walk over here and put it over here.

2979
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:02,180
 So that's going to have to.

2980
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:03,180
 That's my situation.

2981
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:04,820
 Yeah, it's going to have to use a few things, right?

2982
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:10,620
 Like I need machine learning and vision, like literal vision so that I can do object recognition

2983
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:14,580
 so that yeah, so there's going to be some of the scene learning stuff.

2984
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:20,740
 And hopefully one of our mutual friends who's in the middle, not in the middle east, I think

2985
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:25,420
 it was in Thailand and Bali and whatever for a while, he was a former research engineer,

2986
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:27,260
 like AI research engineer at Meda.

2987
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:29,420
 So I'm hoping that me and him.

2988
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:30,420
 Yeah.

2989
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:35,980
 And really like me and him can do some model stuff, develop some models.

2990
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:40,700
 And I also talked to one of my fellow recursant alum.

2991
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:42,820
 And he recently released a game.

2992
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:45,060
 In fact, I want to share it next time.

2993
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:49,820
 He released a game for Oculus Rift or Oculus or whatever the hell it is.

2994
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:50,820
 I don't know this.

2995
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:51,820
 Some kind of game.

2996
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:56,740
 And turns out he's also doing like language stuff as well.

2997
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:57,740
 So we talked today.

2998
02:08:57,740 --> 02:09:01,620
 He was like, yeah, like I would like to kind of help or be involved.

2999
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:05,660
 So maybe me and him will start to do more stuff with this vision app.

3000
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:08,220
 And he's getting his vision, I think tomorrow.

3001
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:10,140
 So yeah, I still.

3002
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:14,860
 So I'm definitely interested in following that journey.

3003
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:15,860
 That's going to be cool, man.

3004
02:09:15,860 --> 02:09:16,860
 Yeah, yeah.

3005
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:19,980
 There's a lot of really interesting stuff coming so long as I don't burn out.

3006
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:20,980
 That's really what it is.

3007
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:24,860
 So I have some other things that I got going behind the scenes.

3008
02:09:24,860 --> 02:09:28,820
 And I'm trying to make it to where, you know, I can share most of it because.

3009
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:29,820
 Yeah.

3010
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:35,100
 Yeah, I'm in a weird spot where I like, I know a lot of people.

3011
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:37,700
 I've done a lot of interesting things.

3012
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:42,580
 And I would like to be able to show that off to other folks who are trying to get into

3013
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:44,460
 this because I think I'm too many people.

3014
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:47,700
 They just look and they're just like, oh, yeah, you can make money.

3015
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:49,620
 And they don't really, they don't really understand.

3016
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:52,700
 Like it's a lot of stuff that goes behind it.

3017
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:53,700
 Like.

3018
02:09:53,700 --> 02:10:00,740
 Do you, are you trying to like race to first a market or you just want to have it like,

3019
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:04,060
 you know, like you don't want to be the first one.

3020
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:08,100
 I mean, I don't, I don't not want to be, but I don't, I guess the right answer is I don't

3021
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:09,100
 care.

3022
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:10,100
 I'm okay.

3023
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,100
 Yeah.

3024
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:12,500
 That's not what you're what you're shooting for.

3025
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:13,500
 Yeah.

3026
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:14,500
 Yeah.

3027
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:15,500
 Yeah.

3028
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:18,900
 I tell people often and I don't know if it really comes across, but I'm doing okay.

3029
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:21,380
 Whereas like, I don't need to do any of these things.

3030
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:29,460
 It's just that I, I basically, I don't know, I don't know if retired is the right word,

3031
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:32,940
 but I thought I was going to retire at like 28.

3032
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:36,380
 And I learned very quickly that that's just boring.

3033
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:37,300
 Like I need to, I don't have that.

3034
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:39,740
 I don't have the mindset for that.

3035
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:41,020
 And I need to do something.

3036
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:42,220
 So that's what this is.

3037
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:44,100
 It's like, this is me doing stuff.

3038
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:48,300
 Like I have a job so I can do stuff so that I'm not always having to figure out what to

3039
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:53,020
 do. I'm doing this so that I can still scratch the itch of me building stuff.

3040
02:10:53,020 --> 02:10:57,580
 I'm doing the other things because I'm like, I have to do, I have to do stuff.

3041
02:10:57,580 --> 02:11:02,060
 So a lot of this is just, it keeps me busy and it keeps me from thinking things that

3042
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:04,380
 I shouldn't be thinking to say it that way.

3043
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:08,740
 So this is what you can call it a distraction or you can call it like, you know, this is

3044
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:11,180
 I need to do something.

3045
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:13,100
 So this is what I do.

3046
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:15,460
 And there'll be more, there'll be more.

3047
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:17,900
 And for those of you who are following, like if y'all enjoy this kind of stuff, let me

3048
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:18,900
 know.

3049
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:24,540
 Because I'm, I've been debating moving away from doing tech stuff on stream because engagement

3050
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:25,980
 is generally very low.

3051
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:29,940
 Whereas if I talk about cultural shit, what's happening in the world somehow the engagement

3052
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:30,940
 is incredibly high.

3053
02:11:30,940 --> 02:11:37,580
 So I mean, so you could, I mean, this is just like an idea of that I would say would just

3054
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:43,780
 have like a, I don't know what your schedule is of streaming if it is going to be like

3055
02:11:43,780 --> 02:11:49,020
 a specific days, but I just have one set aside for each one of those topics, you know.

3056
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:52,180
 So you're not the first person to suggest a schedule.

3057
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:54,540
 And I'll tell you what I tell everyone else.

3058
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:57,500
 I cannot work on a schedule.

3059
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:01,980
 If I, if I set a schedule, it's, that's a good way of saying I will not get it broken.

3060
02:12:01,980 --> 02:12:02,980
 Right.

3061
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:09,620
 It's not even that it's just like it can't feel like work to me because I will stop because

3062
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:11,500
 I don't need it.

3063
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:16,420
 It's hard to explain, but like I need to have my carefree, you know, like I can't, I can't

3064
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:20,380
 go away from that because I know what'll happen if I don't, like if I'm like, man,

3065
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:21,380
 that makes sense.

3066
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:23,380
 I understand what you're saying.

3067
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:24,380
 Yeah.

3068
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:26,260
 So all of this is impromptu.

3069
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:31,580
 And I know that I know that I'm kind of shooting myself in the foot by not having scheduled,

3070
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:34,860
 not having like, you know, here's what we're going to cover.

3071
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:41,140
 But I'm also a, the mindset that the audience who I want, I want them to be okay with that.

3072
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:44,620
 If I had to do all this stuff for other people to appreciate what I'm doing, fuck them.

3073
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:45,980
 That's how I feel real talk.

3074
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:46,980
 Yeah, man.

3075
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:52,140
 I was just going to say because like I can't, you know, I would want to be in every single

3076
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:53,820
 one, checking stuff out.

3077
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:58,220
 But a lot of the times I just got to check out the vibe or I got to check out the video,

3078
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:02,660
 you know, three, four hours after you post it just because, you know, everybody is just

3079
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:04,100
 not in sync like that.

3080
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:06,500
 Like, oh yeah, I feel that grownups.

3081
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:09,500
 And that honestly, that's what I appreciate about YouTube.

3082
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:13,460
 And one of the reasons why I wanted to do YouTube is that the VLD, the videos on the

3083
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:14,460
 men.

3084
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:18,540
 So when I do a stream, like I tell everyone like, you don't have to sit here live.

3085
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:21,860
 Like, in fact, I should even say this.

3086
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:22,980
 I would even sit here live.

3087
02:13:22,980 --> 02:13:27,020
 I would actually, unless you want to ask questions, like if you actually want to engage, that's

3088
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:28,020
 different.

3089
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:32,780
 But if you're just watching, I would say watch the VLD because you can skip through things.

3090
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:37,180
 You can like do like, and eventually you'll have some reason what it is that I do as well

3091
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:41,340
 as like, I don't know if I'm going to do a timeline, but like, I'll do something where

3092
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:44,740
 it's like you'll get an idea of like where you can go in the thing.

3093
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:47,220
 And I'll start doing clips as well.

3094
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:51,180
 So it's like, you know, if you're someone who is just like, you have a lot of stuff going

3095
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:55,700
 on, which I understand, don't, don't build your life around me, please.

3096
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:57,740
 Don't do that.

3097
02:13:57,740 --> 02:14:00,180
 Just watching on VLD.

3098
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:02,380
 That's the powerful thing about YouTube.

3099
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:06,940
 And that's why it's still a stream to YouTube is that when I'm done, immediately you can

3100
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:07,940
 go and watch it.

3101
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:10,900
 And even now you can rewind if you want to go see what we were doing.

3102
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:13,180
 Yeah, that's all the stuff, I guess.

3103
02:14:13,180 --> 02:14:18,620
 I know we didn't really accomplish anything, but I guess we did show what I need to do.

3104
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:22,380
 And this is for you, Yarnie, because I think you were wondering like, like what it is that

3105
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:23,660
 I'm going to be automating.

3106
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:25,500
 Well, it's this, right?

3107
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:28,380
 Yeah, I got the full picture now for sure.

3108
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:30,500
 And there are a few options that I have.

3109
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:36,980
 I've contemplated creating note bindings using note chip, which is a tool that allows you

3110
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:41,540
 to basically bind to other libraries or other languages where like you can use it within

3111
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:42,540
 JavaScript.

3112
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:44,580
 So I'm contemplating doing that.

3113
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:48,420
 But remember, like I can't, I can't have Versailles do this.

3114
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:50,260
 So it's like, it's begging a question.

3115
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:51,260
 Do I even do that?

3116
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:58,020
 Or do I just shell out to, to the, no, to shell essentially on a V, like on a VM that

3117
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:00,900
 I, that I own?

3118
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:04,580
 Yeah, you could do that, by the way, you can, you can shell out and I'll show, I'll leave

3119
02:15:04,580 --> 02:15:05,580
 y'all with this.

3120
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:06,580
 It's a command.

3121
02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:12,220
 Well, it's called fork on the system, but there's another one.

3122
02:15:12,220 --> 02:15:13,540
 There should be one for note.

3123
02:15:13,540 --> 02:15:15,020
 Yeah, here we are.

3124
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:18,620
 No, that's not it.

3125
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:20,460
 Where is, oh, it's under child process.

3126
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:21,460
 Okay.

3127
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,460
 So yeah.

3128
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:27,660
 So I can use this, or I can use a spawn or I can use exact either there are three of

3129
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:28,660
 them.

3130
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:31,980
 They do have differences and they do matter.

3131
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:34,740
 So I haven't figured out which one I'm going to actually need because I don't know what

3132
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:35,860
 I'm going to do yet.

3133
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:42,140
 But I can essentially shell out to the shell and I can run programs that are on my machine.

3134
02:15:42,140 --> 02:15:46,220
 And I can give it the command line, or I can give it all the things that it needs and

3135
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:51,260
 it'll, I can basically programmatically call this from JavaScript.

3136
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:54,860
 Or I can create the bindings to the thing and then like have a library where it's just

3137
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:57,340
 like, it looks like JavaScript.

3138
02:15:57,340 --> 02:16:01,500
 There are certain things that you all have used that aren't actually JavaScript, but

3139
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:07,460
 you don't know it because it's a binding to like some Rust code or to some, to some like

3140
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:09,380
 C code or something like that.

3141
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:13,700
 You see a lot of that in things like Python, for instance, like most of that, most of those

3142
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:18,380
 libraries and machine learning space and AI space, those are written in for trend and

3143
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:24,620
 are in C, C plus plus very few of them are written in Python because Python is slow as

3144
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:28,380
 fuck like this is very slow to do certain things.

3145
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:31,660
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's it.

3146
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,620
 So any questions?

3147
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:37,500
 Was that like an overload?

3148
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:41,220
 Um, no, that was good.

3149
02:16:41,220 --> 02:16:42,220
 I even grabbed.

3150
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:43,220
 Grabbed.

3151
02:16:43,220 --> 02:16:45,220
 Wait, wait, wait, I'm crap.

3152
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,460
 I hope that worked.

3153
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:47,900
 You said that was good.

3154
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:50,980
 You'll hear it on stream if you go back.

3155
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:55,780
 I did my, that's what she said.

3156
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:57,300
 I mean, you left it open.

3157
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:59,300
 I had to, I had to pounce on it, man.

3158
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:02,860
 You can't say that and not have me say that's what she said.

3159
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:04,020
 All right.

3160
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:07,820
 Yeah, with that, um, yeah, I guess you have any questions?

3161
02:17:07,820 --> 02:17:09,220
 It was, you're good.

3162
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:16,100
 Man, I'm, I'm just kind of, I'm, I'm long.

3163
02:17:16,100 --> 02:17:17,420
 I don't understand much.

3164
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:18,420
 See it.

3165
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:20,980
 I'm just going to ask, man, I'm going to just put it like that.

3166
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:27,020
 Well, if you want to learn a little bit of stuff here and there, man, like just tinkering

3167
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:33,260
 around with, you know, uh, raspberry pies and three printers and stuff, you know, just

3168
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:37,180
 playing around in that software, like you got to learn Python, what not.

3169
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:41,980
 But yeah, a lot of these languages that you guys are talking about, I'm just, I'm familiar,

3170
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:42,980
 man.

3171
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:45,460
 To be fair, none of this is computer science.

3172
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:47,700
 I want to be clear here.

3173
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:50,540
 And I've shown this not computer science.

3174
02:17:50,540 --> 02:17:54,580
 It's called firmly in the realm of software engineering and then I'm not even using the

3175
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:55,620
 OS shit right now.

3176
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:56,780
 But if you want to learn C.S.

3177
02:17:56,780 --> 02:17:59,380
 stuff, we can do that.

3178
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:02,900
 That's actually my background is computer science.

3179
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:05,580
 It's not the end, like I didn't start off doing engineering.

3180
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:11,500
 I was actually, I wanted to do computer science research specifically in machine learning around

3181
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:13,140
 a laden bias.

3182
02:18:13,140 --> 02:18:18,860
 And that was kind of what my thesis was when I was doing grad school was around laden bias

3183
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:22,100
 and all of these models that we're now using to make decisions.

3184
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:25,820
 Obviously, well, maybe it's not obvious to some people, but hopefully it's obviously

3185
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:27,220
 all with the complexion.

3186
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:31,300
 Like I really care about this laden bias because it's going to affect me.

3187
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:32,300
 All right.

3188
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:33,300
 So big time.

3189
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:37,220
 Yeah, if you want to learn, you know, C.S. stuff, I'm happy to go through it.

3190
02:18:37,220 --> 02:18:42,100
 But remember everything you're seeing is my excuse for content.

3191
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:45,420
 So it's what I do when I have nothing else.

3192
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:50,220
 So if you have other things, I would rather do other things because this is fine.

3193
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:52,140
 But like this will be here.

3194
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:53,140
 So be here.

3195
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:55,500
 But anyways, I do got to, I do got to wrap up.

3196
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:58,700
 I told my friend I'll meet him downstairs in 10 minutes.

3197
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:00,820
 I told him that five minutes ago.

3198
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:03,140
 So I have a good weekend.

3199
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:04,700
 I'll have a good weekend.

3200
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:06,060
 I'll be on the show.

3201
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:08,220
 I'll be doing a stream tomorrow morning.

3202
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:09,220
 Cool.

3203
02:19:09,220 --> 02:19:11,220
 No time yet.

3204
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:13,100
 Just it'll be tomorrow morning.

3205
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:14,620
 Throw it in a slack or something.

3206
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:15,980
 Oh, yeah, it's always there.

3207
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:16,980
 It's always there.

3208
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:17,980
 You'll see it.

3209
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:18,980
 You'll see it.

3210
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:19,980
 All right.

3211
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:21,980
 Well, y'all have a good rest of the night and I'll see y'all in the future.

3212
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:22,980
 Sure.

3213
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:23,980
 Take care of me.

3214
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:24,980
 Peace.

3215
02:19:24,980 --> 02:19:26,540
 All right.

3216
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:29,020
 So that's kind of where I'm at with.

3217
02:19:29,020 --> 02:19:30,420
 I'm leaving the stream here.

3218
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:31,580
 Kind of.

3219
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:34,660
 If y'all want to see more, I will be doing a live stream tomorrow.

3220
02:19:34,660 --> 02:19:37,860
 I don't know if I'm going to work on what I've been working on, which all we're looking

3221
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:38,860
 at today.

3222
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:40,620
 I'm going to work on my vision app.

3223
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:41,620
 Maybe we'll see.

3224
02:19:41,620 --> 02:19:42,620
 You know what?

3225
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,620
 I'm going to say that.

3226
02:19:43,620 --> 02:19:45,620
 Yeah, we're going to do vision stuff tomorrow.

3227
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:47,180
 I need to do a video as well.

3228
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:52,900
 So if y'all are interested in just seeing that, I'll be online tomorrow before noon,

3229
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:54,900
 my time, central time.

3230
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:59,820
 But yeah, if y'all enjoyed this, I would appreciate a like, follow all of the things.

3231
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:00,820
 I don't know.

3232
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:01,820
 Just help help a brother.

3233
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:02,820
 I'll give me a thumbs up.

3234
02:20:02,820 --> 02:20:04,580
 That actually helps more on YouTube.

3235
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:06,660
 I do stream on Twitch.

3236
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:08,620
 You can follow me there if you prefer Twitch.

3237
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:11,820
 I also stream on Twitter or whatever.

3238
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:16,260
 You can also follow me there if you want to, I don't know, just be updated whenever I do

3239
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:20,900
 these streams because that's actually the best place to get an update because it literally

3240
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:22,940
 does a tweet.

3241
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:26,940
 I don't really say much on Twitter, so you probably won't see much from me there.

3242
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:29,780
 But maybe, you know, maybe in the future.

3243
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:32,500
 Yeah, so with that, I'm going to go ahead and go.

3244
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:34,700
 You all have a good night and thank you all for joining.

3245
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:35,100
 Peace.
